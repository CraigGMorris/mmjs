				<h3>Progressive Web Apps</h3>
				<p>
					Math Minion is configured as a progressive web app (PWA), which brings
					a number of benefits:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A PWA can be installed to operate as a standalone app. It still runs in
						the browser, but in a clean window of its own and with an application icon
						that you can use to launch it, just like a regular app.
					</li>
					<li>
						All of its source is cached on your device, which means it loads
						quickly and can be used offline.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the server source code is updated, the cached code will automatically
						be updated when the app is run and the device is online.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div id="install" class="section">
				<h3>Installing as an App</h3>
				<p>
					While most of the benefits of being a PWA are realized even if you
					don't install it as an app, you may appreciate the cleaner interface
					and ability to launch from an icon. How you install will depend on
					the browser and device you use, but here is of some I have tried.
				</p>
				<p><b>Desktop Chomium Browsers</b><br>
					These browsers, including Google Chrome, MS Edge, Brave and others,
					have a small icon at the right of the address bar when a web app
					can be installed. Hover over it and a tool tip saying something like
					"App available. Install Math Minion". Just click on it and follow the
					instructions.
				</p>
				<p><b>Safari on a Mac</b><br>
					While running Math Minion in the browser, click on the share icon
					on the top bar and select <b>Add to Dock</b>.
					This will place a Math Minion icon on the dock and clicking on it will
					launch a standalone version of Math Minion. As far as I know, there is
					no way to have this icon anywhere else.
				</p>
				<p><b>iOS and iPadOS Devices</b><br>
					While running Math Minion in a browser, tap on the share icon and
					scroll down and select <b>Add to Home Screen</b>. This will place
					a Math Minion icon on the home screen. It can be moved or put in
					a folder like any other app icon.
				</p>
				<p><b>Android</b><br>
					I don't have an Android device to try this on, but it sounds like,
					depending on browser and device, a button saying something like
					<b>Install</b> or <b>Add to Home Screen</b> will appear.
				</p>

			<h3>Help in Standalone App</h3>
			<p>
				Note that when you tap on one of Math Minion's help
				buttons in the standalone app the help opens in the browser in 
				a new tab or window in the browser, rather than in a new app window.
