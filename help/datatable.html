				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					Data tables are used to store <b>static</b> numeric or textual data in a
					tabular form.
				</p>
				<p>
					By "static", I mean that once entered, the data in a cell is not dependent on any
					other values.  A formula can be used to enter a cell's value, but it will be
					evaluated immediately upon entry and only the resultant value, not the formula
					itself, will be stored.  This is different from other Math Minion tools, such as
					expressions and matrices, whose formulas are reevaluated whenever any of their
					inputs change.
				</p>
				<p>
					This makes data tables ideal for storing the kind of information that is often
					stored in spreadsheet or database tables.  The analogy is stronger with the latter
					as spreadsheets mix their data and calculations in the same cells, whereas
					databases and Math Minion store static data in their tables and use external, and
					hence visible, operations to slice and dice this data into other table value
					representations, without altering the source data.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is an exception though, in that you can create data table columns whose
					values are calculated by a single formula. This is really just a display
					convenience that makes it easy display some calculated results, usually involving
					values from other columns, along side the data columns. For instance you might have
					a calculated column displaying the result of adding other columns together.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="columns" class="section">
				<h3>Columns (Fields)</h3>
				<p>
					Unlike the <a href="matrix.html">matrix</a> tool, each column of a data table
					has a name and columns can have a different unit types or can even contain textual
					information.  In this way columns behave much like the fields of a database table,
					with the rows being the records. Columns will normally be data columns, but it is
					possible to define a calculated column if desired.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each data column also has a default formula, which is evaluated whenever a new row is
					added to the table.  The result of this evaluation is used as the initial value
					for that column's cell in the new row.
				</p>
				<p>
					A calculated column has a single formula that must evaluate to an array with the same
					number of rows as the data table has. Individual cells in a calculated column cannot be
					modified.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="infoview" class="section">
				<h3>Information View</h3>
				<p>
					In addition to displaying the rows and columns of data, the information view for a
					data table allows you to modify cell contents, add rows and columns or edit the
					properties of existing columns.
				</p>
				<img src="datatable.png" alt="Expression info view"/>
			</div>
			<div id="addrow" class="section">
				<h3>Add Row</h3>
				<p>
					The <b>Add Row</b> button will add a new row to the bottom of the the table, with default
					values set as defined by the column definition and open a
					<a href="#roweditor">row editor</a> where you can modify those values.
					The <b>Add Row</b> button is disabled if there isn't at least one column defined.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="addcol" class="section">
				<h3>Add Column</h3>
				<p>
					The <b>Add Column</b> will display the <a href="#coleditor">column definition editor</a> with
					some default values.  Change these as appropriate and tap the <b>Add Column</b> button in that
					view to create a new column.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the table already has one or more rows when a data column is added, the initial
					value formula (see the <a href="#coleditor">column definition editor</a>) will be
					evaluated for each existing row and the resulting value used for that row in the
					new column.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="tablecells" class="section">
				<h3>Table Display</h3>
				<p>
					The lower part of the information view shows the table data. You can scroll this
					table both horizontally and vertically by dragging on a cell. Dragging on the row
					or column headers will scroll rapidly.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tapping on a cell that isn't a row or column header will open a
					<a href="#roweditor">row editor</a> displaying
					<a href="formulaeditor.html#fields">formula fields</a> for all the data columns
					and static displays for any calculated columns. You can change the values for data
					columns to any valid formula and as soon as you leave the field, the formula will be
					immediately evaluated and the result placed in that field.  The formula itself is not
					retained though. Tab and shift tab are convenient shortcuts for moving between fields.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note the value you enter must match the unit type for the column, which usually
					means having a unit. such as:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					30 km
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are entering a value into a string column, the normal quote marks can be
					omitted.  If you wish to enter an actual formula into a string column, begin the
					formula with an equals sign to tell Math Minion to evaluate it, rather than just
					taking it as a string.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="tableheaders" class="section">
				<h3>Table Display Headers</h3>
				<p>
					Tapping on a <b>column header</b> cell (i.e. label in top row) will open the
					<a href="#coleditor">column definition editor</a> for that column.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tapping on a <b>row header</b> cell (i.e. row number) will select that row and the
					<b>Add Row</b> and <b>Add Column</b> buttons will be replaced by a
					<b>Delete Rows</b> button.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tapping on additional row headers will select those rows as well.  Tapping
					and holding on a row for a second will select all the rows between it and the
					previously selected row.
				</p>
				<img src="datatabledel.png" alt="Selected Rows"/>
				<p>
					Tapping the <b>Delete 5 Rows</b> button in this view would remove rows 2, 4, 5, 6, 7.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="coleditor" class="section">
				<h3>Column Definition Editor</h3>
				<p>
					Tapping on the <b>Add Column</b> button or on the column header for an existing column
					will bring up an editor where you can define the column properties.  If it is a new column,
					the editor will look like:
				</p>
				<img src="datatablecoledit1.png" alt="New column editor">
				<p>

				</p>
				<p>
					Tapping on header cell for an existing column, will bring up the editor with the fields 
					filled in with the existing values and with some different buttons:
				</p>
				<img src="datatablecoledit2.png" alt="Column Definition Editor"/>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Button Functions</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Cancel</b>: dismisses the editor, without adding a column
							and abandoning any changes made for an existing column.</li>

						<li><b>Add Column</b>: only appears for new columns and when tapped adds the
							new column to the data table and dismisses the editor.</li>

						<li><b>Update</b>: appears instead of the <b>Add Column</b> button when an existing column
							is edited. Tapping it applies changes made and dismisses the editor.</li>

						<li><b>Data</b>: the data label only appears for a new column and tapping it will switch the
							column to a calculated type.  The formula field will be relabelled <b>Column Formula</b> and
							the <b>Data</b> label will change to <b>Calculated</b>. Tapping that will toggle back to the
							data type.<br><br> <b>Note</b>: once added, the column type cannot be changed</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Column Name</h3>
					<p>
						A new column will be given a generic name, but you will almost always want to
						use this field to modify it to something meaningful.  The columns of a given
						data table must have unique names. Having spaces in the names is allowed, but
						not recommended.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Column Number</h3>
					<p>
						This is a number representing the position of the column in the table from 1 for
						to the number of columns starting with the leftmost.  Changing it will move the
						column to the new position.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Initial Value</h3>
					<p>
						This data column formula will be evaluated whenever a new row is
						added to the table.  The result will become the initial value for the column
						cell of the new row.
					</p>
					<p>
						The initial value formula in the image above is:
					</p>
					<p class="formula">
						{mktime {int {date {now}}}}
					</p>
					<p>
						which calls a series of <a href="formula.html#functions">functions</a> to produce
						today's date without any time of day information.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition, when you first add a column, the default value formula has a special
						significance in that its value determines if the column will be a string or a
						numeric column and if numeric, what its unit type will be.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Note</b>: after adding a column, the type of column cannot be changed without
						removing the column and adding it again.
						You can however modify the initial value formula as long as it returns the same
						type of value.
					</p>
					<p>
						The formula can reference other fields to the left of it in the table.
						This reference will return the value for the same row.  This is particularly useful
						when adding a column to a table with existing data.
					</p>
					<p>
						For instance if you wanted to add a column named <b>Next</b> where every
						value was was one day greater than the <b>Date</b> column, the initial value
						formula could be:
					</p>
					<p class="formula">
						$.date + 1 d
					</p>
					<p>
						If desired, the original column could then be deleted and the new one renamed
						and repositioned to replace the first. 
						You would also want to change the initial value formula to something like it originally
						was.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Column Formula</h3>
					<p>
						For calculated columns, the formula is labeled <b>Column Formula</b> and must
						evaluate to an array of the same length as the number of rows in the table.
					</p>
					<p>
						The formula can reference other fields in the table and in this case will return the
						entire column.  This is useful for doing things like displaying a column that is the
						sum of some other columns.
					</p>

				</div>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Display Unit</h3>
					<p>
						If a display unit is not selected, then the default
						<a href="units.html">conversion unit</a> for the column type will be used when
						displaying the table.  Tap the unit or label to open the
						<a href="formulaeditor.html#ubrowser">unit browser</a> to select a unit to be used instead.
						It must be of the same type as determined by the initial value formula when the
						column was first created.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the image above, the time unit <b>Date</b> has been selected as a more human readable
						time value than the underlying seconds since the beginning of 1970.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Format</h3>
					<p>
						You can use this field to format numeric columns. The format string is styled on
						C format string and typically is of the form:
					</p>
					<p class="formula">
						%12.4f
					</p>
					<p>
						which says the field should be 12 characters wide with 4 characters after the
						decimal point in normal floating point format. In Math Minion, the percent sign is
						optional.
					</p>
					<p>An <b>e</b> can be used instead
						of the <b>f</b> for exponential format and you can even show numbers with an arbitrary
						base between 2 and 36.  For instance a value could be represented in hex with
						<b>14.16x</b>.  Note it is also permissable to omit the size number, i.e.
						<b>.2f</b> would be fine and the number would just be right justified.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div id="roweditor" class="section">
				<h3>Row Editor</h3>
				<p>
					When add a row or you tap on any cell in a row, other than the row number, the 
					row editor with appear:
				</p>
				<img src="datatablerowedit.png" alt="Row editor">
				<p>
					It contains the following:
				</p>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Record Number and Count</h3>
					<p><b>Record 1 of 1912</b> - hopefully pretty self explanatory.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Row Navigation Buttons</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><b>&#x21C8;</b> - first record</li>
						<li><b>&#11014;</b> - previous record</li>
						<li><b>&#11015;</b> - next record</li>
						<li><b>&#x21CA;</b> - last record</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Add</h3>
					<p>
						Adds a new row after the current row and display it in the editor. Note that
						while the <b>Add Row</b> button on the main data table page always adds the row
						to the end of the table, this allows you to insert a row into the table.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Delete</h3>
					<p>
						Deletes the displayed row.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Done</h3>
					<p>
						Exits the row editor and returns to the main data table display.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Fields</h3>
					<p>
						Each column is presented with its name and a
						<a href="formulaeditor.html#fields">formula field</a> containing its value. (Calculated
						columns just have an uneditable display).
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div id="import" class="section">
				<h3>Importing, Copying and Pasting</h3>
				<p>
					Many applications, such as spreadsheets, can export data as comma separated
					value (CSV) text files.  These represent tabular data, with each row of data
					being on one line, with the column fields separated by commas or optionally
					another character.
				</p>
				<p>
					By adding 3 simple header lines to the top of a csv file and copying it to the
					clipboard, you can simply paste the result directly onto a Math Minion diagram
					to create a data table.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can also create these csv files, complete with the headers, for many Math Minion
					tools by using the <b>Copy As Table</b> selection from the
					<a href="diagram.html#toolmenu">tool icon menu</a> on the diagram.
				</p>
				<p>
					This makes it easy to create a data table representation of other calculations
					as well as export Math Minion data to other applications.
				</p>
				<p>
					Using expressions to create new representations of a table and then copying it
					and pasting it is an easy way to transform table values into a new static table.
				</p>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>CSV Format</h3>
					<p>
						To create a data table by pasting csv data, it must have three lines added to the top.
					</p>
					<div  data-role="collapsibleset">
						<div class="subsection">
							<h3>First Header Line</h3>
							<p>
								The first must be of the form:
							</p>
							<p class="formula">
								table,en
							</p>
							<p>
								The word "table" is just a flag telling Math Minion you want to create a table.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is followed by a separator character.  This is most commonly a comma, but tabs and semicolons are also common, particularly in regions where commas are used instead of decimal points.
							</p>
							<p>
								The "en" is a locale indicator, in this case for English regions.  This determines how the numbers in data below should be interpreted, in particular the handling of the fraction separator (decimal point in English).
							</p>
							<p>
								For example the headers for a German CSV file might look like:
							</p>
							<p class="formula">
								table;de
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="subsection">
							<h3>Second Header Line</h3>
							<p>
								The second line contains the names to be used for the columns.  These must be double quoted and separated by the separator character.  For instance:
							</p
							<p class="formula">
								"Date","User","Weight","Volume"
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="subsection">
							<h3>Third Header Line</h3>
							<p>
								The third line contains the conversion units that match the values of the data columns below.  These must also be double quoted and separated with the separator character.  If the data for a column is a string, then the unit should be "string".  For example:
							</p>
							<p class="formula">
								"date","string","g","cm^3"
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="subsection">
							<h3>Data</h3>
							<p>
								The rest of the "file" simply consists of the data, with each line representing one row with the column data separated by the separator character.  String values should be in double quotes.
							</p>
							<p>
								Putting it all together a simple CSV representation of a table would look like:
							</p>
							<pre>
table,en
"Date","User","Weight","Volume"
"date","string","g","cm^3"
20120801.0000000000,"Craig",20.0000000000,23.0000000000
20120802.0000000000,"Craig",24.0000000000,28.0000000000
20120803.0000000000,"Craig",19.0000000000,20.0000000000
20120804.0000000000,"Craig",21.0000000000,23.0000000000
							</pre>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h3>Formula Parameters</h3>
				<p class="reminder">
					Parameters that can be accessed in the form a.b where a is the tool and b is the parameter.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the parameter is omitted a table value is returned.  If the parameter is a column name, then the column value is returned as a column array.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other parameters are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>table</b> - also returns a table value.</li>
					<li><b>nrow</b> - number of rows in the table.</li>
					<li><b>ncol</b> - number of columns in the table.</li>
				</ul>
