				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					While Math Minion does all its calculations internally with SI values, conversion units
					allow inputs and outputs in the units of your choice.
				</p>
				<p>
					But beyond simple conversions, Math Minion employs a technique known as
					dimensional analysis in all its numeric calculations.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a very powerful technique for preventing calculation errors.  Understanding
					how Math Minion uses it and other unit features is worth a few minutes of reading.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="dimanal" class="section">
				<h3>Dimensional Analysis</h3>
				<p>
					Despite the scary name, dimensional analysis is pretty simple and highly effective
					at preventing screw ups in your calculations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Essentially it relates every value back to its fundamental SI properties and tracks
					those through calculations to determine the properties of the result.
				</p>
				<p>
					The seven fundamental properties and their SI units are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Length (m)</li>
					<li>Mass (kg)</li>
					<li>Time (s)</li>
					<li>Electric current (a)</li>
					<li>Temperature (K)</li>
					<li>Luminosity (cd)</li>
					<li>Amount of substance (mol)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					For example a velocity value is a length divided by a time value.  Thus
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					60 mile/h
				</p>
				<p>
					has a length power, or dimension, of 1 and a time power of -1.
				</p>
				<p>
					If we divide that by 10 s, then the result has a length power of 1 and a time
					power of -2 and represents an acceleration value.
				</p>
				<p>
					Trying to add another value to it that had a different set of powers, say another
					velocity, would produce an invalid result.
				</p>
				<p>
					Math Minion tracks these powers through all its calculations and will warn you if
					you attempt an illegal operation.
				</p>
				<p>
					It will also show you the type of your calculation results and if they aren't what
					you are expecting. you know you have a problem.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let's say you input the following formula:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					6 mile + 2 km
				</p>
				<p>
					While this would appear to be an illegal mixing of units, it is perfectly correct
					in Math Minion.
				</p>
				<p>
					The calculation would proceed as follows:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The mile unit is associated with a length, so the first term would have a +1
						length power and all other powers 0.
					</li>
					<li>
						The conversion factor for miles to metres would be applied, resulting in 9656.064 m.
					</li>
					<li>
						The 2 km term would also be recognized as a length and the conversion factor for
						km applied to yield 2000 m.
					</li>
					<li>
						The plus operator would check that all the fundamental type powers are the same
						and since they are would perform the additional, resulting in 11656.064 m.
					</li>
					<li>
						Let's say the display unit for this result was set to miles, then the display
						system would check that the calculated result was indeed a length value and then
						display 7.24274 miles.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					What if we changed the formula to:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					6 miles / 2 min
				</p>
				<p>
					The process would be similar to before in that 6 mile would become a length value
					of 9656.064 m and 2 min would become 120 s.  However the divide operator would not
					require the fundamental type powers to be the same.
				</p>
				<p>
					Rather it would subtract all the denominator powers from the numerator powers, which
					would result in a length power of 1 and a time power of -1.
				</p>
				<p>
					This would be associated with the result i.e. 80.4672 m/s.
				</p>
				<p>
					If our display unit were still miles, it would be ignored, 
					since the result type powers no longer match that of the unit mile.
				</p>
				<p>
					Changing the display unit to mph, would result in 180 mph being displayed.
				</p>

			<div id="types" class="section">
				<h3>Unit Types</h3>
				</p>
					A <b>unit type</b> associates a name with a specific set of powers of the fundamental
					SI units.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some examples might be:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Acceleration - length 1, time -2</li>
					<li>Area - length 2</li>
					<li>Density - mass 1, length -3</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The type names don't affect the calculations, but are used for displaying the type of a
					calculation result and also for associating a display unit with a type when defining
					unit display sets.
				</p>
				<p>
					Not every unit combination will have a named type and unit types that don't have named
					definitions will be reported as an "Unknown Type" and the display unit will always be
					comprised of the appropriate combination of fundamental SI units.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="sets" class="section">
				<h3>Unit Display Sets</h3>
				<p>
					A unit display set defines what unit should be used to display a variable of a given
					unit type.  For example the US velocity unit is ft/s.
				</p>
				<p>
					Three sets are hard wired into Math Minion and can't be altered or deleted:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>PureSI</b> - all units are combinations of the fundamental SI units.</li>
					<li><b>SI</b> - derivative units like Watts and Newtons are used where appropriate.</li>
					<li><b>US</b> - common units used in the United States</li>
				</ul>
			<p>
					See below for how to define your own sets.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="unitsview" class="section">
				<h3>Units View</h3>
				<p>
					Tapping the <b>Units</b> button at the bottom of the display will present a view where
					you can select the default unit set as well as define your own custom units and unit sets.
				</p>
				<img src="units.png" alt="Units view"/>
				<p>
					Here the <b>SI</b> set is the default.  Tapping on one of the other names will make that
					set the default.  Note that a custom set that has been named <b>myField</b> has been
					added.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="customunits" class="section">
				<h3>Custom Units</h3>
				<p>
					Tap on the <b>Custom Units</b> button to bring up the custom unit editor.
				</p>
				<img src="customunits.png" alt="Custom Units view"/>
				<p>
					To enter a new unit, simply type the definition into the field at the top of the
					view and tap the return key on the keyboard.  The definition must be of the form:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					newUnitName = number existingUnit
				</p>
				<p>
					where number is what the existing unit would be multiplied by and existing unit is
					a current single or compound unit. See the <a href="formulaeditor.html#ubrowser">unit browser</a>
					for information on the form of a compound unit.
				</p>
				<p>
					An example might be:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					workday = 8 h
				</p>
				<p>
					After defining this unit a formula "1 workday", would resolve to 28800 seconds, or 8 hours.
				</p>
				<p>
					The existing unit can be a compound unit, so it should be possible to define any unit in
					terms of the fundemental SI or other units.  In the image above, two nonsensical units
					have been defined in terms of compound units.
				</p>
				<p>
					To change an existing custom unit, simply redefine it and tap the return key. Tapping on
					the definition will prefill the input field with the existing definition.
				</p>
				<p>
					To delete a unit, just click on its <b>Delete</b> button.
				</p>
				<p>
					To return to the <a href="#unitsview">units view</a> tap on the back button at the upper
					left.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="customsets" class="section">
				<h3>Custom Sets</h3>
				<p>
					On the <a href="#unitsview">units view</a> tap on the <b>Unit Sets</b> button to bring
					up the custom set list.
				</p>
				<img src="unitsets.png" alt="Custom Sets view"/>
				<p>
					To create a new unit set, select an existing set by tapping its row and then
					tap the <b>Clone</b> button to make a copy of it.  You can edit the set name
					in the <b>Name</b> field.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the above image, the US set was cloned and renamed <b>myField</b>.
				</p>				
				<p>
					User sets have an info button on the right and tapping it will open an editor
					where you can modify or delete the set.  Note that you cannot rename or edit the
					unit sets that come preinstalled in Math Minion.
				</p>
				<p>
					To return to the <a href="#unitsview">units view</a> tap the back button at the
					upper left.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="seteditor" class="section">
				<h3>Set Editor</h3>
				<p>
					From the <a href="#customsets">Unit Sets</a> view, tap on the info button on the
					right of a user set to produce its set editor.
				</p>
				<img src="seteditor.png" alt="Unit Set Editor"/>
				<p>
					To change the name of a unit type or the unit associated with it, tap on its row
					then edit the name and unit fields as appropriate. In the image above, the <b>Area</b>
					type has been selected, which has automatically filled in the <b>Name</b> and
					<b>Unit</b> field with the existing values.
				</p>
				<p>
					To create a new type, clear any selection with the  <b>Clear Selection</b> button and
					enter the name and unit in the appropriate fields.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Note</b> that if the unit type defined by the given unit is the same as another
					unit type, an error box will appear and no change will be made.  There can only be
					one defined unit type name for a given set of unit powers.
				</p>
				<p>
					To delete a type just tap its delete button.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="session" class="section">
				<h3>Session Based</h3>
				<p>
					Custom units and sets are stored with individual sessions and are not universal.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you wish to use your custom units and sets whenever you create a new session,
					you could create an otherwise empty template session with those units and sets and
					duplicate it from the <a href="sessions.html#utility">utility menu</a> of the
					<a href="sessions.html">sessions view</a> when you want a new session.
