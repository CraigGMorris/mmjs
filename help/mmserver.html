				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					There can be a number of reasons for hosting your own copy of Math Minion.
					Perhaps you simply want to be able to access it when the Internet is not
					available or perhaps you want to play with the code.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since Math Minion only requires a web server to serve static files, setting
					this up can be pretty easy, particularly if it is just on your personal machine.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="getting" class="section">
				<h3>Getting the Files</h3>
				<p>
					Regardless of how you host Math Minion you will need a copy of the code.
					If you are familiar with git, you can clone the
					<a href="https://github.com/CraigGMorris/mmjs">repository</a> with the
					terminal command:
				</p>
				<p class=formula>
					git clone https://github.com/CraigGMorris/mmjs.git
				</p>
				<p>
					but you can also download a zip archive from github by going to the
					<a href="https://github.com/CraigGMorris/mmjs">GitHub repository</a> and
					clicking on the <b>Code</b> button. This will produce a menu with a
					<b>Download ZIP</b> option. Put the <b>mmjs</b> folder from the expanded
					version where wanted.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="simple" class="section">
				<h3>A Simple Local Server</h3>
				<p>
					Probably the easiest way to host Math Minion or your personal computer is
					with the <b>http.server</b> module of python, especially as you may well
					already have python installed.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you don't already have python installed, you can download python3 from
					the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python.org download page</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					With python3 or python installed, open a terminal window and change into
					the folder (mmjs) containing the source files and enter the command:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					python3 -m http.server 8000
				</p>
				<p>for python version 3 or</p>
				<p class="formula">
					python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
				</p>
				<p>
					if you have a python 2 version.
				</p>
				<p>
					This will start serving the files from that folder and if you go to your browser
					and enter the address:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					http://localhost:8000
				</p>
				<p>
					you should see the Math Minion home page. Click on the <b>Run</b> link to launch
					the program.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other options include running a full featured web server like
					<a href="https://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a>,
					<a href="https://nginx.org/en">Nginx</a> or running a static server with
					<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/HTTP/servers/how-to-serve-static-files/"">nodejs</a>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id= "no_net" class="section">
				<h3>Running Without Internet</h3>
				<p>
					The standard version of Math Minion uses  <b>run.html</b>, which loads the
					libraries for the <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and the
					<a href="https://www.i18next.com/">i18next</a> frameworks from the Internet.
					Thus it won't work without Internet access.
				</p>
				<p>
					However this is just an efficiency thing and the necessary files are actually
					included with the Math Minion code and are used with the <b>rund.html</b> file.
					So simply run Math Minion with an address like the
					following:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					http://localhost:8000/rund.html
				</p>
				<p>
					from your local server and Math Minion should work even if the Internet
					is not available.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h3>Hosting MM on your LAN</h3>
				<p>
					If you run a local server as above and are connected to your home network,
					you can probably access Math Minion from other devices on the network.
					You will need to figure out the IP address your router assigns to the server
					machine and then browse to something like http://192.168.0.12:8000,
					where 192.168.0.12 is the assigned address.
				</p>
				<p>
					I believe most routers will let you lock an IP address to a device's
					MAC (ethernet) address so it doesn't change on reboots etc. If you are
					running a firewall on the host machine, you may also have to adjust its settings.
				</p>
				<p>
					It doesn't require much of a computer to host a static web server, so instead
					of your personal machine, you could also host the files on an older computer
					or even something like a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com">RaspberryPi</a>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="on_net" class="section">
				<h3>Hosting MM on the Internet</h3>
				<p>
					Running a site accessible from the Internet introduces more complications,
					such as acquiring a domain name and a TLS certificate as well as having a
					server that can be accessed from the Internet. Low traffic cloud servers
					are cheap and you can get free TLS certificates from
					<a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a>, but the details of
					setting things up is beyond the scope of this article.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you do decide to try this and need help, feel free to
					<a href="https://www.redtree.com/contact.html">contact me</a>. I am hardly
					an expert, so there is no guarentee I will be able to help, but I will if I can.
