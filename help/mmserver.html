				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					There can be a number of reasons for hosting your own copy of Math Minion. Perhaps you simply want to be able to access it when the Internet is not available or perhaps you want to play with the code.  Because of the security restrictions built into browsers, it will also be necessary if you wish to synchronize your sessions with a <a href="couchdb.html">CouchDB</a> database on your local area network.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since Math Minion only requires a web server to serve static files, setting this up can be pretty easy, particularly if it is just on your personal machine. Below are some thoughts on various scenarios
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h3>Getting the Files</h3>
				<p>
					Regardless of how you host Math Minion you will need a copy of the code. If you are familiar with git, you can clone the <a href="https://github.com/CraigGMorris/mmjs">repository</a> with the terminal command:
				</p>
				<p class=formula>
					git clone https://github.com/CraigGMorris/mmjs.git
				</p>
				<p>
					but you can also download a zip archive from github by going to the <a href="https://github.com/CraigGMorris/mmjs">GitHub repository</a> and clicking on the <b>Code</b> button. This will produce a menu with a <b>Download ZIP</b> option. Put the <b>mmjs</b> folder from the expanded version where wanted.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div  class="section">
				<h3>A Simple Local Server</h3>
				<p>
					Probably the easiest way to host Math Minion or your personal computer is with the <b>http.server</b> module of python, especially as you may well already have python installed.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you don't already have python installed, you can download python3 from the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python.org download page</a>. Strangely MacOS comes with a now deprecated 2.7 version of python installed, but not python3.  This can still be used, but with a slightly different command as shown below.
				</p>
				<p>
					With python3 or python installed, open a terminal window and change into the folder (mmjs) containing the source files and enter the command:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					python3 -m http.server
				</p>
				<p>or</p>
				<p class="formula">
					python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
				</p>
				<p>
					if you have a python 2 version.
				</p>
				<p>
					This will start serving the files from that folder and if you go to your browser and enter the address:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					http://localhost:8000
				</p>
				<p>
					you should see the Math Minion home page. Click on the <b>Run</b> link to launch the program.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other options include running a full featured web server like <a href="https://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a>, <a href="https://nginx.org/en">Nginx</a> or running a static server with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/HTTP/servers/how-to-serve-static-files/"">nodejs</a>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h3>Running Without Internet</h3>
				<p>
					The standard version of Math Minion loads the libraries for the <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and the <a href="https://www.i18next.com/">i18next</a> frameworks from the net, so a small change is required if you wish to run without net access.
				</p>
				<p>
					The necessary files are included with the Math Minion code, so all that is needed is to edit the <b>run.html</b> file in the <b>mmjs</b> folder. Using your favourite text editor, you need to comment out the four <b>script</b> tags referencing <b>unpkg.com</b> and uncomment the four referencing <b>offline</b>. The result should look like:
				</p>
				<pre>
		&lt;!--
		&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/i18next/i18next.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
		&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/i18next-xhr-backend/i18nextXHRBackend.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
		&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.production.min.js" crossorigin&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
		&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.production.min.js" crossorigin&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
		--&gt;
	
		&lt;script src="offline/i18next.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
		&lt;script src="offline/i18nextXHRBackend.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
		&lt;script src="offline/react.development.js" crossorigin&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
		&lt;script src="offline/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
				</pre>
				<p>
					Now loading this file from your local server should work even if the Internet is not available.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h3>Hosting MM on your LAN</h3>
				<p>
					If you run a local server as above and are connected to your home network, you can probably access Math Minion from other devices on the network. You will need to figure out the IP address your router assigns to the server machine and then browse to something like http://192.168.0.12:8000, where 192.168.0.12 is the assigned address.
				</p>
				<p>
					I believe most routers will let you lock an IP address to a device's MAC (ethernet) address so it doesn't change on reboots etc. If you are running a firewall on the host machine, you may also have to adjust the its settings.
				</p>
				<p>
					It doesn't require much of a computer host a static web server, so instead of your personal machine, you could also host the files on an older computer or even something like a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com">RaspberryPi</a>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h3>Hosting MM on the Internet</h3>
				<p>
					Running a site accessible from the Internet introduces more complications, such as acquiring a domain name and a TLS certificate as well as having a server that can be accessed from the Internet. Low traffic cloud servers are cheap and you can get free TLS certificates from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a>, but the details of setting things up is beyond the scope of this article.
				</p>
