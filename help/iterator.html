				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					In most programing languages, loops, like the standard C "for" loop:
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>for (int i = 0; i < last; i++)</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					are commonly used in array and matrix computations, as well as for iterative solutions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Math Minion's array and matrix handling, along with its solvers, remove almost all
					need for such iterative devices.  However there are some circumstances where being
					able to loop through a series of calculations is still useful.
				</p>
				<p>
					Various forms of case studies are probably the most common, but there could be
					iterative problem solutions that can't be completely handled by the built in solvers.
				</p>	
				<p>
					Like the C loop mentioned above, the Math Minion iterator allows you to initialize
					a value, check if the loop should continue and perform some operation before the
					next check.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="loop" class="section">
				<h3>Loop Variables</h3>
				<p>
					There are actually two loop variables in Math Minion's iterator:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>X</b> - This value can be initialized in the <b>Initial X</b> field of
						the iterator view and can be modified at the end of each loop by the formula
						in the <b>Next X</b> field.
					</li>
					<li><b>i</b> - this is a simple loop counter, which starts at 1 and increments
						on each loop.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div id="recorded" class="section">
				<h3>Recorded Values</h3>
				<p>
					You can also add recorded values, whose formulas are evaluated on each loop.
					The resulting values added to the end of an array.
				</p>
				<p>
					These arrays can be accessed as parameters <b>r1</b>, <b>r2</b>, etc.
					The parameters <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, etc. will return the last value of the
					recorded array.  That is the value calculated on the previous loop. A scalar
					0 would be returned if it is the first loop.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you supply a name as a comment to the recorded value formula (that is have a
					single quote followed by a name at the end of the formula), then you can use that
					name as a reference to the recorded value array, rather than the more cryptic R1, R2 etc.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="info" class="section">
				<h3>Information View</h3>
				<p>
					Below is an image of the <a href="infoview.html">information view</a> for
					a rather silly iterator example from the <b>Getting Started</b> session.
				</p>
				<img src="iterinfo.png" alt="Iterator Information View">
				<p>
					Notes on the fields:
				</p>
				<div id="enabled" class="subsection">
					<h3>Enabled</h3>
					<p>
						Turning this on causes the iterator to perform its iterations.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once the iteration is complete, any changes to values that the formulas
						below use will cause the iterator to set <b>X</b> to the <b>Initial X</b>
						value, set <b>i</b> to 1 and start the iteration over.
					</p>
					<p>
						When this is turned off, the loop is set to its initial conditions, but does
						not iterate.
					</p>
					<p>
						If an error of any kind is encountered, this will automatically be turned off.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="addrec" class="subsection">
					<h3>Add Recorded Value</h3>
					<p>
						Tapping this adds a row to the bottom of the Recorded Values section of
						the table below.
					</p>
					<p>
						The formula entered into this row will be evaluated on each step and the
						results stored.
					</p>
					<p>
						These results can be accessed as a iterator parameter. These arrays are named
						R1, R2 etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						If the recorded value formula has a name appended as a comment string
						(i.e. a single quote and a name), then that name can also be used as a
						parameter name to access the results.
					</p>
					<p>
						If the recorded values at each step are themselves arrays or matrices,
						then when accessed, a matrix will be returned with each row being the
						recorded step array or unwound matrix.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="current" class="subsection">
					<h3>Current Values</h3>
						The current values of <b>i</b> and <b>x</b> are shown.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="while" class="subsection">
					<h3>While</h3>
					<p>
						The loop will continue as long as this formula evaluates to a known value,
						whose first element (i.e. row = 1, column = 1) is non-zero.
					</p>
					<p>
						If this condition is satisfied, the <b>i</b> value will be incremented and
						the <b>Next X</b> formula will be evaluated.
					</p>
					<p>
						This formula can access the <b>i</b> parameter (i.e. $.i) and, assuming
						there are formulas for <b>Initial X</b> and <b>Next X</b>, the <b>X</b>
						parameter (i.e. $.x).
					</p>
					<p>
						In the example image above, the condition:
					</p>
					<p class="formula">
						{le $.i, n}
					</p>
					<p>
						is true while <b>i</b> is less than the value of the
						<a href="expression.html">expression</a> tool <b>n</b>, which happens to have
						a value of 6. Note that the current value of <b>i</b> when the iteration is complete
						is 7 and hence the while condition is false.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="initialx" class="subsection">
					<h3>Initial X</h3>
					<p>
						The initial value for loop variable <b>X</b>.  This formula is optional and can
						be blank. The value does not have to be a scalar and in the example its formula
						will yield an array of the integers from 1 to 6, with a unit of metres.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="nextx" class="subsection">
					<h3>Next X</h3>
					<p>
						Following each successful evaluation of the <b>While</b> formula, this formula
						is evaluated and the result assigned to <b>X</b>.  In the example 1 is added to
						every value of the preceding <b>X</b> array.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="recordedv" class="subsection">
					<h3>Recorded Value</h3>
					<p>
						There is a row for each recorded value formula that has been added (see the
						<a href="#addrec">Add Recorded</a> button above).
					</p>
					<p>
						These formulas will be evaluated on each iteration and the newly calculated
						value will be added as a row to the corresponding parameter.
					</p>
					<p>
						Tap on the red <b>X</b> on the right to delete a recorded value.
					</p>
				</div>

			<div id="parameters" class="section">
				<h3>Formula Parameters</h3>
				<p class="reminder">Parameters that can be accessed in the form a.b where a is the tool and b is the parameter</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>i</b> - the current value of the loop counter</li>
					<li><b>x</b> - the current value of the loop variable</li>
					<li><b>initX</b> - the result of evaluating the <b>Initial X</b> formula</li>
					<li><b>while</b> - the current value of the while condition</li>
					<li><b>nextX</b> - the result of evaluating the <b>Next X</b> formula</li>
					<li><b>solved</b> - 1 if the loop has successfully completed, 0 otherwise.</li>
					<li><b>Rn</b> - the array, or matrix, of recorded values corresponding to the recorded value formula number n.  If the formula for a recorded value is followed by a single quote and a name, that name can also be used as a parameter to access the recorded value array.</li>
					<li><b>n</b> - where n is a digit corresponding to a recorded value formula number.  Returns the last value of the recorded value array.  Essentially this is the previously recorded value for that formula.  If <b>i</b> is 1, then a scalar value of 0 is returned. </li>
					<li><b>table</b> - returns a table value where each recorded value array is in a column of the table.  If comments are used on the recorded value formulas, they will be used as the column names, otherwise the formula itself will be.</li>
					<li><b>html</b> - a html code representation of the tool.</li>
					<li><b>notes</b> - the notes for the tool</li>
					<li><b>myname</b> - the name of the tool</li>
