				<h3>That's not Good</h3>
				<p>
					If you get the message that <b>something went wrong</b>, then poor Math Minion is afflicted
					with a bug in its page rendering. Hopefully you will never see this, it is a
					bug and I definitely
					want to hear about it. Please <a href="http://www.redtree.com/contact.html">
						let me know so I can fix it.
					</a>

				</p>
				<p>First though, let's try and get you running again.  Try the following steps:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Try just reloading the page. If the error doesn't immediately reappear, try and see if you
						can reproduce it and <a href="http://www.redtree.com/contact.html">let me know</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the message reappears as soon as the program reloads, but you can see the diagram, try
						tapping on a different tool icon on the diagram and then reload again. If the bug is with
						a specific tool, this will probably work. You may need to remove the problem tool and add
						it back. Again <a href="http://www.redtree.com/contact.html">let me know</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						Try the URL
						<a href="https://mathminion.org/run.html?cmd=/%20new">https://mathminion.org/run.html?cmd=/%20new</a>.
						This should launch Math Minion with a new session. From there you can access the Session page and
						try loading a different session.  If this works, try exporting the problem session to a file and
						<a href="http://www.redtree.com/contact.html">contact me</a>. I may be able to recover the session
						and hopefully fix whatever went wrong.
					</li>
					<li>
						If none of that works, <a href="http://www.redtree.com/contact.html">contact me</a> and I
						will try to help
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Never Ending Calculaton</h3>
				<p>
					I don't think (??) there is a possibility of an actual infinite loop, but even so it is possible to create
					a problem whose resolution might take an unacceptable amount of time. While the user interface will
					remain responsive, the calculation thread will ignore messages from it in such circumstances.
					Even worse, in some cases the calculation may just start again even if you refresh the browser
					or quit and relaunch the app.
				</p>
				<p>
					If this happens, switch to the browser if you are using the app and use this URL:
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="https://mathminion.org/run.html?cmd=/%20new">https://mathminion.org/run.html?cmd=/%20new</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					which should launch Math Minion with a new session. At this point, use the <b>Console</b> button
					at the bottom of the information view to open the console. Then select <b>Console</b> from the drop
					down menu at the bottom and enter:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					/ set noRun t
				</p>
				<p>
					Note: case counts.
				</p>
				<p>
					This will disable the iterative tools, namely:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Equation Solver</li>
					<li>Optimizer</li>
					<li>ODE Solver</li>
					<li>Iterator</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Use the <b>Console</b> button again to toggle off the console and load the
					problem session and try to reconfigure the problem appropriately. Then return to
					the console and enter:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					/ set noRun f
				</p>
				<p>
					to reenable the tools.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="important" class="section">
				<h3>Important</h3>
				<p>
					Please be sure and regularly do an <b>Export All</b> from the
					<a href="sessions.html">Sessions Page</a>. This could be vital for recovery if all else fails!
