				<h3>That's not Good</h3>
				<p>
					If you get the message that <b>something went wrong</b>, then poor Math Minion is afflicted
					with a bug in its page rendering. Hopefully you will never see this, but if you do, I definitely
					<a href="http://www.redtree.com/contact.html">want to hear about it</a>.
				</p>
				<p>First though, let's try and get you running again.  Try the following steps:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Try just reloading the page. If the error doesn't immediately reappear, try and see if you
						can reproduce it and <a href="http://www.redtree.com/contact.html">let me know</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the message reappears as soon as the program reloads, but you can see the diagram, try
						tapping on a different tool icon on the diagram and then reload again. If the bug is with
						a specific tool, this will probably work. You may need to remove the problem tool and add
						it back. Again <a href="http://www.redtree.com/contact.html">let me know</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						Try the URL
						<a href="https://mathminion.org/run.html?cmd=/%20new">https://mathminion.org/run.html?cmd=/%20new</a>.
						This should launch Math Minion with a new session. From there you can access the Session page and
						try loading a different session.  If this works, try exporting the problem session to a file and
						<a href="http://www.redtree.com/contact.html">contact me</a>. I may be able to recover the session
						and hopefully fix whatever went wrong.
					</li>
					<li>
						If none of that works, <a href="http://www.redtree.com/contact.html">contact me</a> and I
						will try to help
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div id="important" class="section">
				<h3>Important</h3>
				<p>
					Please be sure and regularly do an <b>Export All</b> from the
					<a href="sessions.html">Sessions Page</a>. This could be vital for recovery if all else fails!
