					Welcome to Math Minion, my quirky take on a general purpose calculation
					tool. It is a <b><a href="freeprivate.html">free and private</a></b> javascript app
					that runs locally in your web browser.

				<h3>Help Pages</h3>
				<p>
					The top of all help pages start with <b>Section Menu</b> and <b>Help Contents</b>.
					Tapping on <b>Section Menu</b> will expand to a set of links for quickly jumping to
					a section of the current page. Tapping on <b>Help Contents</b> will reveal a list
					of links to all the available help pages.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are new to Math Minion, checking out the
					<a href="tutorial.html"><b>tutorial</b></a>
					might be a good place to start once you have waded through the stuff on
					this Getting Started page.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you can't find the answer in the documentation, or if you have any questions or
					comments, please <a href="http://www.redtree.com/contact.html">contact me</a>.

				<h3>Basics</h3>
				<p>
					Math Minion consists of a <a href="model.html">model</a>, represented by a
					<a href="diagram.html">diagram</a>, on to which you can plop various
					<a href="tools.html">calculation tools</a>, the details of which are displayed
					in an <a href="infoview.html">information view</a>.
				<p>
				<p>
					The most common tool is an <a href="expression.html">expression</a>, which contains
					a single <a href="formula.html">formula</a> that evaluates to a
					<a href="minionvalue.html">minion value</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can use the name of an expression in another formula to represent its calculated
					value. Thus if expression <b>a</b> has formula
				</p>
				<p class="formula">2 + 2</p>
				<p>
					and expression <b>b</b>'s formula is
				</p>
				<p class="formula">a * 2</p>
				<p>
					then <b>b</b>'s value would be 8.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note that a model can contain other models, which will have their own diagrams
					and set of tools.  In this way you can encapsulate larger problems into more
					manageable chunks.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="getstart" class="section">
				<h3>Getting Started Session</h3>
				<p>
					The first time you run Math Minion, a <b>Getting Started</b> session
					("session" is what I call a Math Minion document) will have been automatically
					loaded.  
				</p>
				<p>
					If the browser's display is sufficiently wide, the diagram for the session's
					root model will appear to the left, with an
					<a href="infoview.html">information view</a> to the right.
					On a narrow display, such as a phone, you have to switch between the
					<a href="diagram.html">diagram</a> and the
					<a href="infoview.html">information view</a> by tapping on the button at the lower left
					of the display.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Getting Started session contains examples of most of the key
					<a href="tools.html">tools</a> and features in Math Minion and has extensive
					<a href="notes.html">notes</a> explaining their use. It is an excellent place
					to browse and try things out.
				</p>
				<p>
					Don't worry about screwing it up, for you can always create a new copy by
					clicking on this link:
				<p>
					<a href="../run.html?cmd=/%20loadurl%20../help/Getting%20Started.txt">New Getting Started</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					If that doesn't work for some reason, try copying the command:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					/ loadurl ../help/Getting Started.txt
				</p>
				</p>
					and then clicking on the <b>Console</b> button at the bottom of any
					<a href="infoview.html">information view</a>. Paste the command
					into the input field and hit return to create a fresh copy.
					(<b>Note</b> this will erase any changes you
					have made to the current Getting Started session)
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="examples" class="section">
				<h3>Examples</h3>
				<p>
					In addition to the <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a> and
					<b>Getting Started Session</b>, there are a number of
					<a href="http://www.redtree.com/mmexamples">examples</a> available which illustrate
					various features of Math Minion.
