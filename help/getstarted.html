				<h3>Getting Started Session</h3>
				<p>
					The first time you run Math Minion, a <b>Getting Started</b> session
					("session" is what I call a Math Minion document) will be automatically
					loaded. 
				</p>
				<p>
					It is is a heavily commented guide as well as a
					demonstration of Math Minion's features and tools.  It is an excellent place
					to browse and try things out.
				</p>
				<p>
					Don't worry about screwing it up, for you can always create a new copy by
					clicking on this link:
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Note</b> this will erase any changes you
					have made to the current Getting Started session
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="../run.html?cmd=/%20loadurl%20../help/Getting%20Started.txt">New Getting Started</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					If that doesn't work for some reason, try copying the command:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					/ loadurl ../help/Getting Started.txt
				</p>
				</p>
					and then clicking on the <b>Console</b> button at the bottom of any
					<a href="infoview.html">information view</a>. Paste the command
					into the input field and hit return to create a fresh copy.
