				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					The function solver tool modifies one or more output values until the function
					values calculated from those outputs are zero.  That is, it attempts to find x
					values that satisfy one or more functions of the form:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					f(x) = 0
				</p>
				<p>
					where each x can be either a scalar or an array.
				</p>
				<p>
					The starting value for every x is 0 and normally the solution should fall into
					the range of -1.0 to 1.0.  The output x values are available as parameter 1 for the
					first function, 2 for the second and so on.
				</p>
				<p>
					You access these solver parameters in formulas in your calculation and convert them
					as necessary.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example if the solver tool's name was just "solver" and it had multiple functions,
					the second of which represented the speed of a car, you might first use an
					<a href="expression.html">expression</a> named "speed" with a formula:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					(solver.2 + 100) * 1 kph
				</p>
				<p>
					to convert the dimensionless starting point to 100 kph.  
				</p>
				<p>
					The equation solver will repeatedly try different values for x until all the
					values of all the functions equate to 0.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="methods" class="section">
				<h3>Methods</h3>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Single Value -&gt; Brent</h3>
					<p>
						If there is a single scalar equation, then the Brent method is used and the
						output value is limited to the range -1 to 1 (the function calculation can
						of course scale that to anything).
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Multiple Value -&gt; Broyden</h3>
					<p>
						If it is a multi value problem, then the Broyden method is used. In this case
						the output values can move outside the -1 to 1 range, but it is still good
						practice to scale the problem so all values are approximately normalized.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h3>Information View</h3>
				<p>
					Below is an image of the information view of a solver being used to solver the
					classic Broyden test problem.  This is a bit unusual in that the entire problem
					is contained in the single tool, without reference to other tools.
				</p>
				<img src="broyden.png" alt="Solver information view"/>
				<p>
					The fields are:
				</p>
				<div id="maxiter" class="subsection">
					<h3>Max Iterations</h3>
					<p>
						The maximum number of iterations that will be attempted before the solver
						abandons its attempt with a warning..
					</p>
					<p>
						For a multiple value problem, you can also specify maximum number of iterations
						per jacobian reevaluation. This is ignored for a single value problem.
					</p>
					<p>
						The defaults will almost always be appropriate.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="solve" class="subsection">
					<h3>Solve Checkbox</h3>
					<p>
						The solve box determines whether the solver should attempt to find a solution.
						When it is checked, the solver will automatically run when one of its outputs
						is requested after one of its inputs has changed.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="reset" class="subsection">
					<h3>Reset Button</h3>
					<p>
						Tapping this button will reset the output parameter values to 0 and uncheck
						the solve enable box.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="addfunc" class="subsection">
					<h3>Add Function Button</h3>
					<p>
						This is used to add additional functions to the solver, which will add a row to the
						<a href="#funclist">function list</a> below.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="funclist" class="subsection">
					<h3>Function List</h3>
					<p>
						The table at the bottom of the view has a definition for each function added to the solver.
						Each definition has the following elements:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>f1, f2 etc</b> - the function definition formula.  In the image above, these
							formulas directly reference the solver tool x values using the <b>$</b> shortcut
							to refer to itself.  i.e.
							<p class="formula">
								$.1
							</p>
							<p>
								refers to the x1.  In most cases the formulas will be referencing other tools that
								have performed calculations on the solvers x values.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>nx</b> - when an function is added to a solver, a corresponding array of x values
							will be created and will be accessible to other tools as a parameter of the solver.
							The size of this array will initially be 1 (i.e a scalar), but you can change
							the size by using this <a href="formulaeditor.html#fields">formula field.</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>x1, x2 etc.</b> - the current output values of the solver.  When reset these will
							all be 0 and when solved, will be the values required to have all the function values
							equal to zero.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>fx1, fx2 etc.</b> - the current function evaluation. When solved, these should all
							approximate zero.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>X</b> - tapping on the red X will delete that function.  This will only appear if
							there is more than one function as there must be at least one function.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div id="parameters" class="section">
				<h3>Formula Parameters</h3>
				<p class="reminder">Parameters that can be accessed in the form a.b where a is the
					object and b is the parameter</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>n</b> - output value n - e.g. 1.</li>
					<li><b>fn</b> - calculated value n, where n is the number of the function producing
						the value - e.g. f2</li>
					<li><b>cn</b> - the array size (count) for output n and function n - e.g. c3</li>
					<li><b>solved</b> - 1 if the optimization has completed successfully, otherwise empty</li>
				</ul>
