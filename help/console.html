				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					The console is mainly used for development and debugging and so can probably be
					ignored otherwise.  For those still reading I will provide a brief overview, starting
					with a few words about Math Minion's internal structure.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="structure" class="section">
				<h3>Program Structure</h3>
				<p>
					When Math Minion runs, all the calculations take place in a separate process called a
					web worker and all the user interaction and display occurs in the main program. The
					main program communicates with the calculation engine by passing it text commands.  When
					the engine completes the command, it sends a message back to the main program containing
					text in the form of JSON.  The interface uses these replys to construct what you see.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="view" class="section">
				<h3>Console View</h3>
				<p>
					The console allows you to directly type commands and have them sent to the calculation
					process and displays the corresponding results.
				</p>
				<p>
					It only has three fields:
					<ul>
						<li>A large, uneditable text area where the results are displayed.</li>
						<li>An input field where you type a command.</li>
						<li>A <b>Read Command File</b> button, which will let you select a file of
						commands to be executed.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="commands" class="section">
				<h3>Commands</h3>
				<p>
					Commands take the form of a subject path, followed by an action, possibly followed by an
					object or other action parameter.  If the subject path is omitted, the default
					subject is used.
				</p>
				<p>
					The top of the subject tree is the session, which has the path "<b>/</b>".  Children are
					separated by dots, so "<b>/.root</b>" is the root model and "<b>/.root.x</b>" is the tool
					named <b>x</b> in root.
				</p>
				<p>
					At start up, the default subject is root and if a path does not start with "<b>/</b>", it
					will be relative to the default subject.  Thus "<b>.x</b>" would also refer to the tool named
					<b>x</b> in the root model, unless the default subject has been changed. In Math Minion, the
					current subject is the model being viewed in the diagram unless changed with the <b>cd</b>
					command.
				</p>
				<p>
					The command <b>help</b> will list the commands the subject understands.  If the help
					command is followed by one of those commands, a very brief usage message will be
					displayed.
				</p>
				<p>
					A command history is maintained while the console is open and can be navigated with the
					up and down arrows on the keyboard.
