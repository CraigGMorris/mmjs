			<h3>CoolMM</h3>
			<p>
				Having once had some background in chemical engineering software, I have long been intrigued with the idea of adding a fluid flash tool to Math Minion.  Thus when I discovered that the open source <a href="http://coolprop.org" target="_blank">CoolProp</a> property package had a Javascript wrapper based on web assembly, I couldn't resist doing just that.
			</p>
			<p>
				The result is a <b>CoolMM</b> version that can be run at at:
			</p>
			<p class="formula">
				http://coolmm.mathminion.org
			</p>
			<p>
				However please be patient for CoolProp is written in C++ and is compiled into web assembly. This allows it to be incorporated in Math Minion and run directly in the browser, but it also means there is a lot of code to download. Otherwise this version is identical to the normal version of Math Minion.
			</p>

				CoolProp aims to emulate RefProp from NIST and as might be expected from the name, seems to do best with refrigeration and steam problems, but does have a range of other mainly light components. I did experience some strange flash behaviour and failures in the an example with a multicomponent natural gas like compositions.  I discuss some of it in the example.
