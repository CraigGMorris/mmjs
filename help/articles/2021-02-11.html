<h3>Web Browser Math Minion</h3>
<p>
	What I guess you could call my covid project has been to make a web browser based
	version of Math Minion. If you are interested and have a fairly recent browser,
	have look at <a href="http://www.mathminion.org" target="_top">mathminion.org</a>.  As always,
	<a href="http://redtree.com/contact.html" target="_top">comments</a> are appreciated.
