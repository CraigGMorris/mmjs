				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					Every <a href="tools.html">Math Minion tool</a> can have notes associated with it.
					Beside the name field at the top of every tool
					<a href="infoview.html">information view</a> there is a button
					labeled <b>Add Notes</b> or <b>Show Notes</b> if notes have already been added.
					Tapping that will open the notes view.
				</p>
				<img src="notesview.png" alt="Notes View">
				<p>
					You can enter any text you want into the large text area of the notes view.  Tapping on
					the <b>Hide Notes</b> button beside the name field will return to the normal
					<a href="infoview.html">information view</a>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h3>Diagram Notes</h3>
				<p>
					If you wish to have your notes appear on the diagram, tap on the button labeled
					<b>Show on Diagram</b>. The notes will appear on the diagram below the tool icon
					and the button will change to <b>Hide on Diagram</b> as in the image above.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note that if the note is very long, it might be truncated on the diagram.
				</p>
				<p>If a tool has notes and they are not shown on the diagram, there will still
					be the word <b>Notes</b> below the icon to indicate the tool has hidden notes.
