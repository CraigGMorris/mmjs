				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					Any <a href="tools.html">Math Minion tool</a> can have notes associated with it.
					To the right of the name and display fields at the top of every tool
					<a href="infoview.html">information view</a> there is a button
					labeled <b>Notes</b> that will open the notes view.
				</p>
				<img src="notesview.png" alt="Notes View">
				<p>
					You can enter any text you want into the large text area at the bottom of the notes view.
					Tapping on the <b>Done</b> button, which has now replaced the <b>Notes</b> button, will
					assign the notes to the tool and return to the normal <a href="infoview.html">information
					view</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you switch to another tool by tapping on the diagram without tapping on either the
					<b>Done</b> button or one of the buttons immediately below it, any changes you made to
					the note text will be discarded.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="model" class="section">
				<h3>Show in Model View</h3>
				<p>
					If you want the notes to appear in the <a href="model.html">Model's</a> information view,
					tap on the <b>Show in Model Html</b> button. The button label will change to
					<b>Hide in Model Html</b> and when you view the model's informaton view, the notes will
					appear above the tool's display.  That assumes that the tool has its <b>Display</b> box set,
					but even if isn't the note will still appear. 
				</p>
				<p>
					This means you can add text to the view by just having a note displayed, without the tool
					itself being displayed.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="diagram" class="section">
				<h3>Diagram Notes</h3>
				<p>
					If you wish to have your notes appear on the diagram, tap on the button labeled
					<b>Show on Diagram</b>. The notes will appear on the diagram below the tool icon
					and the button will change to <b>Hide on Diagram</b> as in the image above.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note that if the note is very long, it might be truncated on the diagram.
				</p>
				<p>If a tool has notes and they are not shown on the diagram, there will still
					be the word <b>Notes</b> below the icon to indicate the tool has hidden notes. Whether the
					notes are displayed or just the <b>Notes</b> indicator, tapping on the top of the diagram
					notes will display them in a pop up.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="parameters" class="section">
				<h3>Notes Parameter</h3>
				<p>
					You can access the notes for any tool in a formula with the <b>notes</b> parameter.  For
					example the formula:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					velcocity.notes
				</p>
				<p>
					would return a string value containing the notes for tool <b>velocity</b>.
