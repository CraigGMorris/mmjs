				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					It can occur that a problem requires the same calculation to be used in a number
					of places with differing inputs.  This is easily accomplished by creating a
					<a href="model.html">model</a> containing
					<a href="expression.html">input expressions</a> for the calculation
					and then copying and pasting it as appropriate with different input formulas.
				</p>
				<p>
					In most cases this is sufficient and has the advantage of being straightforward
					and transparent.  However if after copying a <a href="model.html">model</a>
					numerous times into varying sessions, you discover that you want to modify the
					model and want to have those changes reflected in all the copies, they must
					all be modified.
				</p>
				<p>
					An alternative for these more complicated situations is to have the
					<a href="model.html">model</a> import its structure from another session.
				</p>
					Every time a session containing such models is loaded, the contents of the models
					are read from the root <a href="model.html">model</a> of the imported sessions and
					thus any changes to those sessions will be reflected in all the models that import them.
				</p>
					The <a href="formula.html">formulas</a> for the input
					<a href="expression.html">expressions</a> are retained by the importing
					<a href="model.html">model</a> so they aren't overwritten by the default
					imported values.
				</p>

				<h3>Importing Models</h3>
				<p>
					To add an imported model, choose the <b>Imported Model</b> option from the
					<b>Add Tool to Model</b> menu of the
					<a href="diagram.html#bgmenu">diagram background menu</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					This will produce a normal <a href="model.html#info">model information view</a>
					except it will now have an additional <b>Source Session</b> section at the top.
				</p>
				<img src="imported.png" alt="Source Session Section">
				<p>
					The name of the session whose root model is the template should be entered into
					the input field (PSCalc in the example).
				</p>
				<p>
					The <b>Make Local</b> button changes the imported model to a normal
					<a href="model.html">model</a> that is no longer updated if changes are
					made to the template session.  Note this isn't reversable other than by
					removing the model and adding the imported model again.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other than this section and the <a href="diagram.html">diagram</a> icon being
					labeled <b>Imported</b> rather then <b>Model</b> an imported model behaves like
					a normal model.  You can even make changes to it, but any changes other than to
					its input <a href="expression.html">expressions</a> will be lost when the session
					is reloaded.
