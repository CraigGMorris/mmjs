				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					An expression has a single <a href="formula.html">formula</a> representing an equation
					or constant in your calculation.
				</p>
				<p>
					It's name can be used in other formulas to represent the value it calculates.  Thus if
					an expression named <b>speed</b> has a formula that is just:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					100 kph
				</p>
				<p>
					and a second expression <b>distance</b> has a formula:
				</p>
				<p>
					speed * 2 h
				</p>
				<p>
					The value of <b>distance</b> will be 200 km.
				</p>
				<p>If instead of a scalar, <b>speed</b> was a 2x2 matrix of <b>kph</b> values:
				<table class="formula">
					<tr><td>25</td><td>50</td></tr>
					<tr><td>75</td><td>100</td></tr>
				</table>
				</p>
				<p>
					then the <a href="infoview.html">information view</a> for the <b>distance</b> expression
					would look like:
				</p>
				<img src="expression.png" alt="Expression info view"/>
				<p>
					Tapping on <b>Length: m</b> and selecting <b>km</b> as the display unit would result in:
				</p>
				<img src="expression2.png" alt="Expression info view"/>

			<div id="inputs" class="section">
				<h3>Inputs</h3>
				<div class="subsection">
					In addition to the name field and notes button, an expression has:
				</div>
				<div id="incheck" class="subsection">
					<h3>In Checkbox</h3>
					<p>
						When checked, this designates that the expression is considered to be an input for the
						<a href="model.html">model</a> that contains it.
					</p>
					<p>
						This means it will appear in the input section of the
						<a href="model.html">information view</a> of the model's parent model.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also any values it references will be from the parent model, rather than the model
						that contains it (unless there is no parent model, because the expression is in
						the root model).
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="outcheck" class="subsection">
					<h3>Out Checkbox</h3>
					<p>
						When on, the value calculated by this expression will appear in the output section
						of the <a href="model.html">information view</a> of the model that owns it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also this expression will be available as a parameter of the owning model that can be
						accessed in <a href="formula.html">formulas</a>.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="formula" class="subsection">
					<h3>Formula Field</h3>
					<p>
						The <a href="formulaeditor.html#fields">formula field</a> has the
						<a href="formula.html">formula</a> that defines the value of the expression.
					</p>
					<p>
						Tapping on the equal sign to the left of the formula field will cause the expression
						to be reevaluated.  This is normally only pertinent for formulas using something like
						the <b>{now}</b> function, to force them to replace their cached values. It can also be used to
						regenerate error and warning dialogs resulting from the calculation.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="unit" class="subsection">
					<h3>Display Unit</h3>
					<p>
						Below the formula, the unit type (e.g. length) of the value calculated by the formula
						is displayed, along with the <a href="units.html">conversion unit</a>
						(e.g. m, ft etc.) to be used for displaying the value.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you wish to display the value with a different unit, tap on the unit to open a 
						<a href="formulaeditor.html#ubrowser">unit browser</a> where you can select a different one.
						In the image above this has been done to display the results in <b>km</b>>, rather than the default
						<b>m/s</b> of the <b>SI</b> <a href="units.html#sets">unit set</a> used by this session.
					</p>
					<p>
						Note that setting the display unit does not change the formula or the value it
						calculates, but merely how it is displayed. However the display unit must match
						the type of the value calculated by the formula.
					</p>
					<p>
						If the result of evaluating the formula is a
						<a href="minionvalue.html#table">table value</a>, then the unit field will normally
						be blank and the unit browser will be disabled, since different columns might have
						different units.
					</p>
					<img src="tablevalue.png" alt="Expression table value"/>
					<p>
						However if you tap on the column name header in the calculated value grid,
						the <a href="formulaeditor.html#ubrowser">unit browser</a> will be displayed to
						let you select a display unit for that column.
					</p>
					<p>
						Note that the default unit for a table value is defined by the original table
						definition.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="calculated" class="section">
					<h3>Calculated Value</h3>
					<p>
						The lower part of the view displays the result of the calculation as a matrix or
						table.  If the display won't fit in the window, you can scroll it both horizontally
						and vertically by dragging it. Dragging on the row or column headers will scroll
						rapidly.
					</p>
					<p>
						Tapping on a cell will show the contents of the cell in a large text area in a new
						view. For a number value, this allows you to see greater precision as well as copy
						the value to the clipboard.  For string values, which might be far larger than can
						be displayed in a cell, it allows you to see the whole string in a scrollable view
						as well as copying all or part of it to the clipboard.  Tapping the <b>Done</b>
						button on this view will return to the main view.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div id="parameters" class="section">
				<h3>Formula Parameters</h3>
				<p class="reminder">
					Parameters that can be accessed in the form a.b where a is the object and b is the
					parameter.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the expression is a reference to another object, then that object's parameters will
					be available.
				</p>
				<p>
					Similarly if the result of the expression is a table value, then the table value
					column names will all be parameters.
				<p>
					Other parameters:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>table</b> - regardless of the result type, it will be returned as a table value.</li>
					<li><b>hasValue</b> - returns 1 if a value can be calculated for the expression
						formula or 0 if not.</li>
				</ul>
