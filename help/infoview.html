				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					The information view is where you define the inputs for <a href="tools.html">tools</a>
					as well display their calculated results.  It is also used for the saving and loading
					of sessions and defining conversion units and their sets, among other things.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the display is wide enough, it is displayed to the right of the
					<a href="diagram.html">diagram</a>, otherwise you switch between the diagram and the
					information view using buttons on the toolbar at the bottom of the display.
				</p>
				<p>
					Regardless of what information it is displaying, the view always has the same toolbars
					at the top and bottom of the display
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="topbar" class="section">
				<h3>Top Toolbar</h3>
				<img src="infotop.png" alt="Top of an information view"/>
				<p>The image above is the top of an information view for an
					<a href="expression.html">expression</a> named "radius", which is a member of a
					<a href="model.html">model</a> named "circle".
				</p>
				<p>
					The name of whatever is being displayed always appears in the center of the toolbar
					and tapping on it has no effect.
				</p>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Back</h3>
					<p>
						At the left is a back button with the name of whatever you will go back to if you
						tap it.  In this case, as with all information views pertaining to Math Minion tools,
						it is the name of the <a href="model.html">model</a> the tool lives in and tapping it
						will switch the view to showing information for that <a href="model.html">model</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you are already viewing the information for a <a href="model.html">model</a>, the
						<a href="diagram.html">diagram</a> will also switch to displaying the parent
						<a href="model.html">model</a>. The back button does not appear for the root model
						information since it doesn't have a parent.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Help</h3>
					<p>
						The help button at the right of the toolbar will open the help page for whatever is
						currently being viewed.  In this case it would be the
						<a href="expression.html">expression help page</a>.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Tool Information</h3>
					<p>
						When viewing the information for a tool, an editable field for the tool name always
						appears immediately below the toolbar. There is also a <b>Display</b> check box  
						and a <b>Notes </b> button.
					</p>
					<p>
						When the display box is checked, information about this tool will appear in the
						information view of the parent model. This allows the creation of simple reports or
						forms for the model.
					</p>
						Tapping the notes button will open a<a href="notes.html">notes view</a> where you
						can define notes for the tool.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div id="bottombar" class="section">
				<h3>Bottom Toolbar</h3>
				<p>
					The bottom tool bar has six buttons.  From right to left they are:
				</p>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Expand/Diagram/Info</h3>
					<p>
						When the information view is shown along with the <a href="diagram.html">diagram</a>
						the right most button will say <b>Expand</b>.  Tapping it will cause the information
						view to expand to the full size of the display, hiding the
						<a href="diagram.html">diagram</a>. This button will then change to <b>Diagram</b>
						and tapping it will return to the two pane view.
					</p>
					<P>
						If only the information view is shown because the display is too narrow for two
						panes, then this button will be labeled <b>Diagram</b> and tapping it will switch
						to the <a href="diagram.html">diagram</a>.  In this case the toolbar will continue
						to be displayed at the bottom of the diagram and the button will now be labelled
						<b>Info</b>. Tapping it will switch back to the information view.
					</P>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Sessions</h3>
					<p>
						This button will produce a view of the currently saved sessions and tools for
						saving, creating, deleting, importing and exporting them. The
						<a href="sessions.html">sessions help page</a> is a must read.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Console</h3>
					<p>
						This shows the <a href="console.html">console view</a>, which allows text commands
						to be sent directly to the underlying calculation engine. It is mainly of use when
						developing or debugging Math Minion code and can probably be ignored otherwise.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Undo and Redo</h3>
					<p>
						These two buttons can be used to, surprise, undo and redo actions.  They will be
						grayed out if they have no available action.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection">
					<h3>Units</h3>
					<p>
						Math Minion has a pretty sophisticated conversion unit system which also provides
						dimensional analysis to numeric calculations.  This button opens a
						<a href="units.html">units</a> view where the default unit set can be selected
						and custom units or unit sets defined.
