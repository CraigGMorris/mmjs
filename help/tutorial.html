				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					This tutorial will just touch on the basics of Math Minion, while
					the <a href="getstarted.html">Getting Started session</a>
					and the <a href="helppage.html">help pages</a> are the primary
					resources.
				</p>
				<p>Links to  help pages will be used liberally in the following.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="getstart" class="section">
				<h3>Getting Started</h3>
				<p>
					When you access Math Minion for the first time or on a new server,
					in a new browser or the first time running the Mac app,
					the <a href="getstarted.html">Getting Started session</a> will
					be loaded. 
				</p>
				<p>
					It is is a heavily commented guide as well as a
					demonstration of Math Minion's features and tools.
					It and the <a href="helppage.html">help pages</a> are the
					primary documentation resources for Math Minion and
					it is well worth checking out when you are done here.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="windows" class="section">
				<h3>Windows</h3>
				<p>
					If your browser window is wide enough. you will see something
					like this when Math Minion starts:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/getstarted.png" alt="Getting Started">
				<p>
					On the left is a <a href="diagram.html">diagram</a> showing the various
					tools contained in the root model. A model is simply a collection of tools, possibly
					including other models.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the right is an <a href="infoview.html">information view</a> about the currently
					selected <a href="tools.html">tool</a>, or if no tool is selected,
					as is this case here, about the model itself.
					The information view for a model can show results for tools it contains
					and in this case the <a href="htmlpage.html">Html Page</a> named
					<b>Welcome</b> is displayed. 
				</p>
				<p>
					On a narrow device, like a phone, you probably will just see the
					<a href="infoview.html">information view</a>, but on the
					<a href="infoview.html#bottombar">bottom button bar</a> there will be an
					<b>Diagram</b> button that will switch to the <a href="diagram.html">diagram view</a>.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/phoneinfobtns.png" alt="Phone diagram button">
				<p>
					This will have a corresponding <b>Info</b> button that will switch back.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/phonedgmbtns.png" alt="Phone info button">
				<p>
					With the split view, which should appear even on a phone if you rotate the device
					to the horizontal, the <a href="infoview.html#bottombar">button bar</a> will look
					like:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/infobuttons.png" alt="Information view buttons">
				<p>
					Tapping the <b>Expand</b> button will expand the info view to take up the entire
					window and the <b>Diagram</b> button will appear again.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="new" class="section">
				<h3>Start a New Session</h3>
				<p>
					On the <a href="infoview.html#bottombar">button bar</a> discussed above. tap the
					<b>Sessions</b> button to bring up a view of the saved
					<a href="sessions.html">sessions.</a> If you haven't run Math Minion before, Getting Started will
					be the only one.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/sessionstop.png" alt="Top of sessions view">
				<p>
					Tap the <a href="sessions.html#new">New</a> button to start a new session.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tap anywhere on the diagram and then on the <b>Add Expression</b> line. A new
					<a href="expression.html">expression</a> icon will appear on the <a href="diagram.html">diagram</a> and the
					<a href="infoview.html">information view</a> will show the expression.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="expr" class="section">
				<h3>Expressions</h3>
				<p>
					The <b>Expression</b> information view should look something like this.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/expression.png" alt="The x1 expression">
				<p>
					All an expression tool does is evaluate a single
					<a href="formula.html">formula</a>, but it is almost
					always the most commonly used tool.
				</p>
				<p>
					The name field and name have already been selected, so just type <b>BMI</b> and
					hit return. Yes, I know all the controvery about Body Mass Index, but it is a
					nice short, well known formula to play with.  Namely:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					BMI = weight/height^2
				</p>
				<p>
					where weight is in kilograms and height is in metres.
				</p>
				<o>
					After hitting return in the name field, you should be positioned in the
					expressions <a href="formulaeditor.html">formula field</a>.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmi1.png" alt="Now the BMI expression">
				<p>
					Enter the formula:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					80 kg / (6 ft + 1 in)^2
				</p>
				<p>
					and hit return.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmi2.png" alt="Calculated BMI">
				<p>
					The mixed <a href="units.html">conversion units</a> have been dealt
					with and an answer returned in the SI units BMIs are reported in.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let's do this a bit differently. Tap the <b>+Exp</b> button beside
					the <b>Display Input</b> check box.
					This will create another empty expression. Name it <b>Weight</b>, enter
					the formula 80 kg and check the <b>Display</b> and
					<b>Display Input</b> check boxes. It should look like this:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmiweight.png" alt="The Weight expression">
				<p>
					Tap the <b>+Exp</b> to create a third expression and name it <b>Height</b>.
					Enter the formula <b>6 ft + 1 in</b> and again check the <b>Display</b> and
					<b>Display Input</b> check boxes. It should look like this:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmiheight.png" alt="The Height expression">
				<p>
					and the diagram will now look like this:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmidgm1.png" alt="Diagram with weight and height icons">
			</div>
			<div id="feditor" class="section">
				<h3>Formula Editor</h3>
				<p>
					Let's return to the original BMI expression and revise the formula
					to use the new <b>Weight</b> and <b>Height</b>
					expressions and take a tour of
					the <a href="formulaeditor.html">formula editor</a>. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Tap on the <b>BMI</b> icon on the diagram to return to that expression
					and check the display checkbox, since I appear to have done so before
					taking these screen shots. &#128522;
				</p>
				<p>
					Then tap on the expand <b>&#10530;</b> icon to the right of the formula.
					This will bring up the formula editor. (Note you can also hit the return
					key while holding down shift in the formula field.)
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmifedit1.png" alt="Formula editor">
				<p>
					While it is convenient to enter simple values and formulas right in a
					formula field, the formula editor offers a number of tools to make
					composing a formula easier. We are going to completely replace our existing
					formula, so select everything inside the text area and delete it:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmifedit2.png" alt="Empty formula editor">
				<p>
					The area in the bottom part of the screen shows various previews,
					depending on where the cursor is in a formula and whether a preview
					button has been pressed. Note that you can adjust the relative sizes
					of the formula input and preview areas by dragging on the up/down icon <b>&#8597;</b> to the right of the <b>Apply</b>
					button.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this case the cursor is in a position where you are most likely to
					want to enter a value or a tool name, so the preview area lists the
					tools currently in the model. If you enter an <b>w</b>, the list will
					be filtered, in this case down to just weight.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmifedit3.png" alt="Formula editor with 1 character">
				<p>
					As long a you have entered at least one character, hitting the tab key
					will insert the top entry in the list, here
					<b>Weight</b>, into the formula. You can also just tap on any entry to
					insert it. Go ahead and do that and then enter a slash, followed by a
					1 and a space, so it looks like this:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmifedit4.png" alt="Formula editor with unit preview">
				<p>
					The cursor is preceeded by a number and a space, which suggests
					you may want to enter a conversion unit for the number, so all
					defined conversions units are displayed in the scrollable preview area.
					Type an <b>o</b> (oh) character and the list will be filtered to just
					these:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmifedit5.png" alt="Formula editor with O unit preview">
				<p>
					Rather than picking one, backspace over the <b>o</b> and tap on the
					<b>Units</b> button <b>ABOVE</b> the formula. This will show the 
					<a href="formulaeditor.html#ubrowser">unit browser</a>, which lets
					you browse through units by type.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the left hand side will be a list of unit types. Scroll down to
					<b>Mass</b> and tap on it.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmiunits1.png" alt="Unit browser">
				<p>
					Now the right hand side lists all the defined mass units.
					Tap on <b>lb</b> and hit the apply button.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmifedit6.png" alt="Unit browser">
				<p>
					The <b>lb</b> unit has been inserted at the cursor position
				</p>
				<p>
					Okay, erase the <b>1 lb</b> and type a open curly brace <b>{</b>.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmifunc1.png" alt="Function preview">
				<p>
					Math Minion function calls consist of a open curly brace immediately
					followed by the function name and then a comma separated list of
					arguments, if any, any finally a closing curly brace.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since we have entered an opening brace, the preview area has been
					filled with a list of all the available functions. Like the other
					previews, it will be filtered as we type characters.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are just playing around here, so just enter a tab to insert the
					<b>{abs x}</b> function.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmifunc2.png" alt="Function inserted inot formula">
				<p>
					After inserting the function, the cursor is positioned before
					the first argument. If we enter a question mark at this position,
					we get:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmifunc3.png" alt="Function description">
				<p>
					which shows a brief description of the function in the preview area.
				</p>
				<p>
					Erase the inserted function and tap the <b>Functions</b> button above
					the formula area.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmifunc4.png" alt="Function browser">
				<p>
					There isn't much I can add to the instructions at the top of the view.
					Browse through the functions if you wish and then just hit cancel to
					return to the formula editor.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let's finally complete the formula to calculate BMI again by adding
					<b>height^2</b> after the divide sign.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmifedit7.png" alt="Current result preview">
				<p>
					With the cursor at the end of the line and no space after the 2,
					Math Minion has nothing to suggest as a completion, so it reverts
					to showing the <b>Current</b> value for the expression, that is the value
					calculated from the original formula before any editing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Click on the preview button and you will get this:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmifedit8.png" alt="Calculated result preview">
				<p>
					This now shows the result of calculating the edited formula. As hoped
					the value is the same as the previous formula and the only
					difference in the display is the <b>Current =</b> label has changed to
					<b>Preview =</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Try selecting just the word <b>height</b> and tap the preview button
					again.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmifedit9.png" alt="Calculated height result preview">
				<p>
					With <b>height</b> selected, the preview, now labeled <b>Selection =</b>,
					shows the value of evaluating just the selected text. This is really
					handy if your formula isn't giving you what you want or has an error.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="modelview" class="section">
				<h3>Model View</h3>
				<p>
					If you now tap on the <b>&lt; root</b> button at the top left of the
					information view, you will return to viewing the root model, which
					now looks like this:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmiroot1.png" alt="Root model view">
				<p>
					Those display boxes we were checking told the model to display the input field
					and calculated result for both the <b>Weight</b> and <b>Height</b> expressions
					and just the calculated result for <b>BMI</b>. Try tapping in the input field
					for weight and change it to 81 kg.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmiroot2.png" alt="Modified root model view">
				<p>
					The new BMI is shown immediately and demonstrates that the model view
					is now a convenient little form.
				</p>
				<p>
					The diagram now looks like this:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmidgm2.png" alt="Root model diagram">
				<p>
					The lines running from the corners of the <b>Weight</b> and <b>Height</b>
					icons to the middle of a vertical side of the <b>BMI</b> icon indicate that
					the <b>BMI</b> tool uses the values of <b>Weight</b> and <b>Height</b>. It is
					kind of trivial in such a simple example, but quite useful when lots of tools
					are involve in a model.
				</p>
				<p>
					Drag the <b>BMI</b> icon over to the right so the diagram looks something like
					this:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmidgm3.png" alt="Modified root model diagram">
				<p>
					Notice that the fields in the information view have been rearranged to have
					the <b>BMI</b> at the bottom. The fields in a model information view are
					arranged according to the position of the tool icons on the diagram, with
					left most ones first and any ties being resolved in favour of the top most ones.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmiroot3.png" alt="Modified root model view">
				<p>
					Looking at this, it probably isn't necessary to show the calculated results of
					the <b>Weight</b> and <b>Height</b> icons.  Tap on either the <b>Weight</b> icon
					or one of the <b>Weight</b> labels in the information view to show that expression
					again. Uncheck the <b>Display Input</b> box and then do the same for the
					<b>Height</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Return to the model information view (tap <b>&lt; root</b>) and it should now
					look like this:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/bmiroot4.png" alt="Further modified root model view">
				<p>
					Tapping on that little printer icon in the upper right of a model or html page
					tool would bring up a print dialog that would let you print the contents of the
					information view or save it as a PDF.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="dgm" class="section">
				<h3>Diagram</h3>
				<p>
					A few quick notes about the diagram:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You can drag the background around to pan the whole diagram.</li>
					<li>You can drag icons to rearrange them.</li>
					<li>You can zoom the diagram in and out by, depending on your device:
						<ul>
							<li>Tapping on the <b>+</b> and <b>-</b> buttons at the top right.</li>
							<li>Scrolling with your mouse wheel or track pad</li>
							<li>Using a pinch gesture on the screen or trackpad</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Tapping on the background will bring up a
						<a href="diagram.html#bgmenu">context menu</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						Tapping on an icon will show its information view or if the view is
						already showing, it will dismiss it.
					</li>
					<li>
						Tapping and holding on an icon for a couple of seconds before releasing
						will produce a <a href="diagram.html#toolmenu">tool menu</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						Tapping and holding on the diagram background for a couple of seconds
						before releasing will produce a selection box with the upper left at the
						tap point. It can be resized by dragging the upper left or lower right
						corners. Any icons partially inside the box will be selected.
					</li>
					<li>
						Tapping inside a selection box will produce a
						<a href="diagram.html#selmenu">selection menu</a>.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div id="saving" class="section">
				<h3>Saving Sessions</h3>
				<p>
					Math Minion continously saves your work in a
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indexed_Database_API">browser database</a>
					so that even if you exit Math Minion without even naming your session, it will still
					be there when you come back.
				</p>
				<p>
					However if you are working on an unnamed session and
					want to create or load another session,
					you have to go to the session view (using the <b>Session</b> button at the bottom of
					the <a href="infoview.html">information view</a>) and tap the <b>Save</b> button. 
					You will be asked for a name and afterwards can return to the saved session by tapping
					on its name in the session view.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once the session is named, there is no need to use the <b>Save</b> button to save
					changes you may make to it. They will be automatically saved.
				</p>
				<p>
					However it is a good idea to export your sessions to device or cloud files fairly
					often. There is an <b>Export All</b> button on the session view that will export
					your entire collection of sessions to a single file that can be imported if necessary
					or if you wish to have the sessions in another browser or device.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>NOTE:</b> As part of Apple's antitracking efforts, all Safari browsers and
					all browsers on iOS and iPadOS automatically delete the entire database if you
					don't visit the site for seven days. While protection from tracking is nice,
					it is unfortunate that there is no way I know of that a user can tell it not
					to do this for a specific site.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other browsers on PCs, and I imagine Android, do not do this, although exporting
					your stuff frequently is probably still a good idea.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="conclusion" class="section">
				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>
					That is it for this very basic introduction. It barely touched on the things
					Math Minion can do, so you might want
					to go back to the <a href="getstarted.html">Getting Started session</a>
					and browse through its examples and descriptions as well as other help pages.
				</p>
