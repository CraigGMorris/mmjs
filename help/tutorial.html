				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					This tutorial will attempt to introduce the basics of Math Minion.
					To keep the size manageable, I won't repeat all the stuff from other
					<a href="getstarted.html#help">help pages</a>, but I will try to use lots of
					links to relevant pages and sections.
				</p>
				<p>So let's get started.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="getstart" class="section">
				<h3>Getting Started</h3>
				<p>
					When you access Math Minion for the first time or on a new server or from a new browser,
					the <a href="getstarted.html#getstart">Getting Started session</a> will
					be loaded and if your browser window is wide enough. you will see something
					like this:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/getstarted.png" alt="Getting Started">
				<p>
					On the left is a <a href="diagram.html">diagram</a> showing the various
					tools contained in the root model. A model is simply a collection of tools, possibly
					including other models.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the right is an <a href="infoview.html">information view</a> about the currently
					selected <a href="tools.html">tool</a>, which in this case is the root model itself.
					Results for tools contained by a model can be displayed on its information view
					and in this case the HtmlPage named welcome is displayed. 
				</p>
				<p>
					On a narrow device, like a phone, you probably will just see the
					<a href="infoview.html">information view</a>, but on the
					<a href="infoview.html#bottombar">bottom button bar</a> there will be an
					<b>Diagram</b> button that will switch to the <a href="diagram.html">diagram view</a>.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/phoneinfobtns.png" alt="Phone diagram button">
				<p>
					This will have a corresponding <b>Info</b> button.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/phonedgmbtns.png" alt="Phone info button">
				<p>
					With the split view, which should appear even on a phone if you rotate the device
					to the horizontal, the <a href="infoview.html#bottombar">button bar</a> will look
					like:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/infobuttons.png" alt="Information view buttons">
			</div>
			<div id="new" class="section">
				<h3>Start a New Session</h3>
				<p>
					On the <a href="infoview.html#bottombar">button bar</a> discussed above. tap the
					<b>Sessions</b> button to bring up a view of the saved
					<a href="sessions.html">sessions.</a> If you haven't run Math Minion before, Getting Started will
					be the only one.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/sessionstop.png" alt="Top of sessions view">
				<p>
					Tap the <a href="sessions.html#new">New</a> button to start a new session.  The
					<a href="infoview.html">information view</a> should now be empty except for the
					name field for the <b>root</b> <a href="model.html">model</a> and the
					<a href="diagram.html">diagram</a> should be blank.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/blanksession.png" alt="Blank Session">
			</div>
			<div id="add" class="section">
				<h3>Add Expressions</h3>
				<p>
					Tapping any where on the diagram background will produce this
					<a href="diagram.html#bgmenu">background menu</a>:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/dgmbgmenu.png" alt="Diagram background menu">
				<p>
					Tap on <b>Add Expression</b> to create an <a href="expression.html">expression tool</a>.
					An icon will appear on the <a href="diagram.html">diagram</a> where you originally tapped:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/expricon.png" alt="Expression Icon">
				<p>and the top of the <a href="infoview.html">information view</a> will become:</p>
				<img src="tutorial/x1info.png" alt="New expression info view">
				<p>
					Note, if you make a mistake, you can probably just tap the <b>Undo</b>
					button on the <a href="infoview.html#bottombar">bottom button bar</a>
					to reverse it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tap in the name field (currently has <b>x1</b>) and change the name to <b>square</b>
					and hit return.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now tap in the <a href="formulaeditor.html#fields">formula field</a> (to the right of the equals
					sign) and enter the <a href="formula.html">formula</a>:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					2 m * 200 cm
				</p>
				<p>
					and hit return.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <a href="infoview.html">information view</a> should now like this: 
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/square1.png" alt="square expression info">
				<p>
					The current <a href="units.html#sets">conversion unit set</a> is SI, so the value
					is displayed in <b>m^2</b> and Math Minion recognizes that as an <b>Area</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Math Minion is pretty rigorous about conversion units and uses
					<a href="units.html#dimanal">dimensional analysis</a> to
					ensure units can be mixed in appropriate ways.
				</p>
				<p>
					All Math Minion values are matrices, so this scalar
					appears as a 1x1 matrix.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tap on the <b>Units</b> button at the bottom of the information view
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/infobuttons.png" alt="Information view buttons">
				<p>
					to get the units view:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/unitsview.png" alt="Units view">
				<p>
					Tap on <b>US</b> to select US units and then on the <b>&lt; square</b> button
					at the upper left to return to the square expression. (Everything that is blue in
					information views has a tappable action).
				</p>
				<p>
					The result for <b>square</b> is now shown in the default US area unit of <b>ft^2</b>.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/squareus.png" alt="square expression in US units">
				<p>
					Repeat the steps above to switch back to <b>SI</b> units so that square again
					shows the result in square metres.
				</p>
				<p>
					Okay, let's try something different. Click on the background again and select
					<b>Add Expression</b> to create another expression. Name it
					<b>angles</b> and then tap on the <b>&#10530;</b> icon to the right of the
					<a href="formulaeditor.html#fields">formula field</a>. This will bring up a
					<a href="formulaeditor.html#editor">formula editor</a> which allows us to
					edit larger more complex formulas, but also has some helpful tools.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/formulaedit1.png" alt="Empty formula editor">
				<p>
					Enter the formula
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					1:72
				</p>
				<p>
					into the text area and then tap the <b>Preview</b> button at the bottom. You
					should see something like:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/formulaedit2.png" alt="Formula editor with preview">
				<p>
					The area at the bottom has been filled with the result of evaluating the formula.
					In this case it is a column array with elements from 1 to 72, which is what the
					colon operator does. You can scroll or drag on the table to see more values and
					dragging on the row number column will scroll through it quickly.
				</p>
				<p>
					go back to the formula and add <b>*10</b> and a space, so it looks like:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/formulaedit3.png" alt="Edited formula">
				<p>
					and tap on the <b>Units</b> button to bring up the
					<a href="formulaeditor.html#ubrowser">unit browser</a>. Tap on
					<b>Dimensionless</b> in the left hand column and then <b>degree</b> in the right
					column, which should give you this:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/unitpicker.png" alt="Unit browser">
				<p>
					Tap the <b>Apply</b> button and <b>degree</b> will be inserted into the formula at the cursor
					location:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/formulaedit4.png" alt="Complete angles formula">
				<p>
					Tap the <b>Apply</b> button to assign the formula to the angles expression.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/angles1.png" alt="Angles expression with fraction units">
				<p>
					That doesn't look right for 10 times 1 to 72 should be 10, 20, 30 etc. However note the
					display unit is <b>Fraction</b> which is the default unit for the <b>Dimensionless</b>
					unit type. In fact the values are in radians as degrees have been converted to the base
					unit.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tap on <b>Dimensionless: Fraction</b> and the
					<a href="formulaeditor.html#ubrowser">unit browser</a> should reappear with
					the <b>Dimensionless</b> type already selected. Choose <b>degree</b> from the right
					hand column and <b>Apply</b> it. This should result in:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/angles2.png" alt="Angles expression with degree units">
				<p>
					which is what we expected. Note that all values and calculations are done internally
					in SI base units and selecting different units for display has no effect on the actual
					values calculated.  Similarly all inputs are converted to SI base units immediately.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now create another expression and name it <b>sine</b> and then tap on the <b>&#10530;</b>
					icon to the right of the its <a href="formulaeditor.html#fields">formula field</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the resulting <a href="formulaeditor.html#editor">formula editor</a>, if you enter
					<b>{s</b> in the text editor, you should see something like this:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/formulaedit5.png" alt="Function preview">
				<p>
					The preview area now shows all the functions that start with <b>s</b>. If you were to type
					additional characters, the list would be shortened appropriately, but just tap on
				</p>
				<p class="formula">{sin x}</p>
				<p>
					to insert the function into your formula to give you this.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/formulaedit6.png" alt="formula inserted">
				<p>
					Math Minion functions are always enclosed in curly braces <b>{...}</b>, with the name of
					the function immediately following the opening brace.  The parameters, if any, follow as
					a comma separated list followed by the closing brace.
				</p>
				<p>
					Inserting a function with the function preview or function browser will place the cursor
					before the first argument. You will almost always have to replace the arguments, but they
					are included as reminders. If you type a <b>?</b> in front of the first argument, the
					preview area will show a brief description of the function:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/formulaedit7.png" alt="preview function description">
				<p>
					Remove both the <b>?</b> and the <b>x</b> and you will get the following:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/formulaedit8.png" alt="parameter preview">
				<p>
					The preview area now displays all the available tool names. Typing will reduce the list
					appropriately, so typing an a will reduce the list to just <b>angles</b>. Hitting
					<b>Tab</b> after you have entered one or more characters will insert the name at the top
					of the list into the formula or you can just tap on one of the names in the list. Do either
					so the formula reads:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					{sin angles}
				</p>
				<p>	
					The function preview is handy when you have an idea of what function you want, but you
					will sometimes want to browse through the functions and their descriptions to see what
					is available.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tap on the
					<b>Functions</b> button to open a
					<a href="formulaeditor.html#fbrowser">function browser</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The functions are presented in groups like log functions, trig functions etc.,
					which expand to show the actual functions when you tap on them.
				</p>
				<p>
						For instance, tap on <b>Trigonometric math functions</b> row and then on
						<b>{sin x}</b> in the list that is revealed. You should see the description of
						the function and an <b>Insert</b> button.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/fbrowser.png" alt="Function browser">
				<p>
					Tapping on the <b>Insert</b> button would return you to the function editor with
					the function inserted, but as we already have the function in our formula, just tap
					the <b>Cancel</b> button.
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/formulaedit9.png" alt="final sine formula">
				<p>
					Tap the <b>Apply</b> button to assign the formula to the <b>sine</b> expression. The
					information view should now look like this:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/sinangles.png" alt="Sine angles">
				<p>
					The sine of all the elements of the array calculated by the <b>angles</b> expression
					appear in the table at the bottom. In general Math Minion operators and functions work
					on all elements of their arguments.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <a href="diagram.html">diagram</a> will now look something like the following,
					although your icons will probably be in different positions,
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/diagram1.png" alt="Diagram">
				<p>
					You can drag the icons around to arrange them however you want. You can also zoom
					in or out with a pinch or scroll action or use the <b>+</b> and <b>-</b> buttons at
					the upper right.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tapping on the title <b>root</b> in this case will automatically resize and recenter
					the diagram. If present, the <b>&#8660;</b> symbol on the right can be dragged to resize
					the information view. Tapping on any icon will present its information in the information
					view.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note the line going from the corner of the <b>angles</b> expression to the center of one of the
					vertical sides of the <b>sine</b> expression. This indicates that the <b>sine</b> expression
					is using the value of <b>angles</b> in its calculations.
				</p>

				<h3>Plotting Results</h3>
				<p>
					Tap on the <a href="diagram.html">diagram</a> background again and this time select 
					<b>Add Display Tool</b> and then <a href="graph.html">Graph</a> from the resulting menu.
					Rename it <b>Plot</b> and the information view will look like this:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/singraph1.png" alt="Empty graph information view">
				<p>
					Enter <b>angles</b> in the <b>x1</b> <a href="formulaeditor.html#fields">formula field</a>
					and <b>sine</b> in the <b>y1_1</b> one. Note that the unit beside <b>angles</b> is
					<b>Fraction</b>. Tap on it and select <b>degree</b> from the
					<a href="formulaeditor.html#ubrowser">unit browser</a> and <b>Apply</b> it.
				</p>
				<p>
					 Now tap the <b>Plot</b> button to show the plot:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/singraph2.png" alt="Sin plot">
				<p>
					Dragging the graph around will result in the axis labels changing accordingly. You
					can also <a href="graph.html#zoom2d">zoom in and out</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note that we have made a small mistake in that the plot begins at 10 degrees, rather than
					0 degrees.
				</p>
				<p>
					Go back to your diagram, which may now look something like this:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/diagram2.png" alt="Diagram">
				<p>
					and tap on the <b>angles</b> icon and change the formula in the resulting
					information view to
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					0:72*10 degree
				</p>
				<p>
					Hit return and then click on the graph icon <b>Plot</b> and the correction should be visible:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/singraph3.png" alt="Sine plot">
				<p>
					Add one last expression named <b>table</b> and enter the its function editor. Type a
					<b>p</b>, which will reduce the preview list to just <b>plot</b>. Now type a dot and you will
					see:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/formulaedit10.png" alt="plot parameter preview">
				<p>
					The preview area now shows all the parameters available from the graph tool <b>Plot</b>.
					There are quite a few, but typing a <b>t</b> should reduce the list to just <b>table</b>
					and <b>table1</b>. Tap <b>table</b> and apply the formula to get:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/plottable.png" alt="plot table">
				<p>
					which represents the lines of the plot as a table value.
				</p>
				<p>
					To finish up, tap on the <b>Sessions</b> button at the bottom of the information view and then
					on the <b>Save</b> button. A dialog will appear asking for a name to save the session as:
				</p>
				<img src="tutorial/savedialog.png" alt="Save dialog">
				<p>
					Give it a name and tap <b>Ok</b> to save the session in the browser's database. Note that
					this occurs on your local device and nothing is sent over the network. For added safety I
					frequently use the <b>Export All</b> button on the <a href="sessions.html">Sessions</a>
					view to save a copy of everything to a file on my device.

					<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					<p>
						That is it for this very basic introduction. It barely touched on the things
						Math Minion can do, so you might want
						to go back to the <a href="getstarted.html#getstart">Getting Started session</a>
						and browse through its examples and descriptions as well as other help pages.
