				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					Math Minion HTML pages provide a way to present customized input and result views.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the name implies, HTML is used to format the view and javascript to manipulate
					the inputs and results, so to make use of this tool some familiarity with HTML
					and javascript is necessary. However if you aren't familiar with them, you can
					pretty safely ignore HTML pages as they mainly just provide pretty interfaces to
					existing calculations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Input consists of a single formula that should return a string value containing
					the HTML to be displayed. This formula can be any valid Math Minion formula,
					but often simply consists of a single quote, followed by the desired HTML.
				</p>
				<p>
					A <b>&lt;mm&gt;</b> HTML extension, as well as a supplied javascript function,
					<b>mmpost</b>, permit the page to interact with other Math Minion tools.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="formula" class="section">
				<h3>Formula Field</h3>
				<p>
					At the top of the information view is
					<a href="formulaeditor.html#fields">formula field</a> that defines the HTML.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <a href="formula.html">formula</a> it contains must return a string value
					comprised of the HTML code to display.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="render" class="section">
				<h3>Rendered Page</h3>
				<p>
					The rendered HTML is displayed in a sandboxed <b>iframe</b> immediately below the
					<a href="formulaeditor.html#fields">formula field</a>.
					Rendering in this way prevents malicious code in the tool from interacting directly
					with the main program code.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="mm" class="section">
				<h3>The <b>&lt;mm&gt;</b> Tag</h3>
				<p>
				Special <b>&lt;mm&gt;</b> tags containing Math Minion formulas can be embedded
				within the HTML and these tags will be replaced with the results of evaluating the
				formulas before the HTML is rendered.  For instance the code:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					&lt;mm&gt;person[1,"weight"]&lt;/mm&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
					would be replaced with the string representing value of the first row of
					the "weight" column of the tool named <b>person</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the value isn't a scalar, then an HTML table will be inserted. The default HTML code
					formula used for a new html page contains CSS definitions that aim to make the table
					easier to read. These can of course be removed or modified to taste.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the <b>&lt;mm&gt;</b> tag returns a <b>Graph</b> tool reference, the graph will be be
					inserted (as SVG) into the page.
				</p>
				<p>
					The default formula also provides some examples of the use of the <b>&lt;mm&gt;</b> tag.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="mmpost" class="section">
				<h3>mmpost Function</h3>
				<p>
					A function named <b>mmpost</b> is automatically inserted into the HTML to be rendered.
					Javascript on the page can call this function to make input values on the page available
					as string parameters of the HTML page tool.  These can then be accessed by other tools
					in the <a href="model.html">model</a> to perform calculations.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <b>mmpost</b> can also request values from the model, which will be returned in
					a call back function passed to <b>mmpost</b>.  Special requests can also be used to
					trigger specific actions discussed below.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <b>mmpost</b> function is defined with three arguments:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					mmpost(inputs, requests, callBack)
				</p>
				<div id="inputs" class="subsection">
					<h3>Inputs Argument</h3>
					<p>
						This argument should be an array of strings, where each string is the <b>id</b>
						of some sort of HTML input element that has a value. The string value of each of
						those elements will become a parameter of the HTML page tool, with the id as
						the name.
					</p>
					<p>
						For example the <b>onClick</b> handler for the <b>Calculate</b> button of the
						BMI page looks like:
					</p>
					<p class="formula">
						onClick="mmpost(['weight', 'height']);"
					</p>
					<p>
						where <b>weight</b> and <b>height</b> are the ids of the text input fields where
						values are entered. For instance the input element for weight is:
					</p>
					<p class="formula">
						&lt.input type="text" id="weight" value="&lt;mm&gt;$.weight&lt;/mm&gt;" class="input"&gt;
					</p>
					<p>
						Note that the value for the field uses a <a href="#mm">&lt;mm&gt; tag</a> to get the
						previous value for weight. The dollar sign is the
						<a href="formula.html">formula</a> shorthand reference to the tool owning
						the formula, i.e. the HTML page itself. Any previous input of weight would have
						created a weight parameter for the tool because of the call to mmpost and that
						value will automatically be filled in when this tool is viewed again. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The height and weight are also used by the <b>BMI</b>
						<a href="expression.html">expression</a> in the BMICalc
						<a href="model.html">model</a> to calculate the BMI. This is obviously a
						ludicrously complex way to calculate such a simple thing, but useful for
						illustration.  The result is displayed on the HTML page with another
						<a href="#mm">&lt;mm&gt; tag</a>: 
					</p>
					<p class="formula">
						&lt;mm&gt;BMICalc.BMI&lt;/mm&gt;
					</p>
					<p>
						So when a new weight is entered in the weight field and the <b>Calculate</b>
						button is pressed, <b>mmpost</b> reads the weight and height values and replaces
						the current weight and height parameters of the html page tool.  This will cause
						all the tools that reference the HTML page to forget their results.  The page will
						be rerendered, which will request the <b>BMICalc.BMI</b> value, which will in turn
						get the new weight and height and return a new BMI to be displayed.
					</p>
					<p>
						These input parameters are retained by the MM HTML forms when sessions are saved,
						so the tool will always have the last inputs posted to it.  If an empty array is
						passed to <b>mmpost</b>, then the previous inputs will be retained.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="requests" class="subsection">
					<h3>Requests &amp; Callback</h3>
					<p>
						The <b>mmpost</b> function can also be used to directly request one or more
						formulas be evaluated.  This is done by providing an object containing formulas
						as the request argument.  These formulas will be evaluated and the function passed
						as the callback argument will be called with an argument consisting of a results
						object having the same keys as the request object with the associated values being
						the result of evaluating the corresponding formula.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the code below, the second column of matrix is requested with the key <b>mat</b>.
						The callback function retrieves the result from result.mat and uses it to format
						lines that are used as the value of a textarea element.
					</p>
					<pre class="formula">
&lt;textarea id="results"&gt;
  placeholder
&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  const target = document.getElementById('results');
  mmpost([], {mat: 'nMatrix[0,2]'}, (result) =&gt; {
    const value = result.mat;
    const lines = [];
    let i = 1;
    for (const v of value) {
      lines.push(`row ${i++} = ${v}`);
    }
    target.value = lines.join('\n');
  });
&lt;/script&gt;
					</pre>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div id="actions" class="section">
				<h3>Actions</h3>
				<p>
					A number of actions can be requested by passing specific action keys in the
					<b>mmpost</b> request object.
				</p>
				<div id="view" class="subsection">
					<h3>View - mm_view</h3>
					<p>
						A request with the key <b>mm_view</b> having a the name of another tool as a value
						will result in the information view and diagram selection switching to that tool.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="push" class="subsection">
					<h3>Push - mm_push</h3>
					<p>
						A request with the key <b>mm_push</b> having a the name of another tool as a value
						will result in the information view for that tool being pushed over top the current
						one.  Tapping the back button at the top left of the information view will switch
						back to HTML page information view.				
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="addrow" class="subsection">
					<h3>Adding Rows - mm_addrow</h3>
					<p>
						A request with the key <b>mm_addrow</b> having the name of a
						<a href="datatable.html">data table</a> tool as a value will cause the data table to
						add a row to the table.
					</p>
						This is done after the HTML page has been updated with any inputs passed to
						<b>mmpost</b>.  If the data table that is having the row added references these
						inputs either directly or indirectly in its initial value formulas, then the
						values of the new row can result from the inputs of the HTML page.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you look at the HTML page named <b>BMI</b> in the Getting Started session,
						when the Record button on the page is tapped, the weight is passed in the
						input argument of <b>mmpost</b> and <b>{mm_addrow: 'weight'}</b> is passed as the 
						request argument.  No call back is supplied. The <b>Initial Value</b> formula
						for the <b>Weight</b> column of the table is:
					</p>
					<p class="formula">
						{eval bmi.weight}
					</p>
					<p>
						so the entered weight will be used in the the new row. In this case the weight
						parameter will be a string since it includes the unit, so the eval function is
						used to evaluate it as formulas.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="deleterows" class="subsection">
					<h3>Delete Rows - mm_deleterows</h3>
					<p>
						A request with a key <b>mm_deleterows</b> can be used to remove specified rows
						from a data table. The value associated with the key must itself be an object
						containing:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>table: name of the data table</li>
						<li>rows: an array of row numbers to delete</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						For instance to delete the last row of a table named <b>weight</b>, the following
						could be used:
					</p>
					<p class="formula">
						{mm_deleterows: {table:'weight', rows: &lt;mm&gt;weight.nrow&lt;/mm&gt;]},
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="refresh" class="subsection">
					<h3>Refresh - mm_refresh</h3>
					<p>
						When a Math Minion object calculates new values, it normally remembers those
						until one of its inputs changes or a new session is loaded.
					</p>
					<p>
						However in some circumstances, such as an expression using the current date and
						time using the {now} function, you may want an object to forget its retained
						value and recalculate it.  A <b>mmpost</b> request with a key <b>mm_refresh</b>
						having a tool name as its value will cause that tool to recalculate.  For
						example:
					</p>
					<p class="formula">
						mmpost({},{mm_refresh: 'todaysDate'})
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="clear" class="subsection">
					<h3>Clear - mm_clear</h3>
					<p>
						The inputs included in an <b>mmpost</b> call remain as tool parameters until they are
						changed, but in some cases you may wish to remove all of these as start fresh.
						Calling <b>mmpost</b> with a request object containing a key <b>mm_clear</b> will
						do this.  The value of the key is unimportant, but typically just <b>true</b>.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="update" class="subsection">
					<h3>Update - mm_update</h3>
					<p>
						Calling <b>mmpost</b> with a request containing a key <b>mm_update</b> simply causes
						the HTML page to be redisplayed.  This isn't often necessary, but might be combined
						with a <b>mm_clear</b> to redisplay the cleared page.  It might look like:
					</p>
					<p class="formula">
						mmpost({},{mm_clear: true, mm_update: true})
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="load" class="subsection">
					<h3>Load Session - mm_load</h3>
					<p>
						You may want to break some activities up into different sessions,
						but still be able to access them directly from the HTML page.
					</p>
					<p>
						If a call to <b>mmpost</b> has a request with a key <b>mm_load</b>, an a session name
						as its value, then Math Minion will attempt to load a session with that name.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="loadurl" class="subsection">
					<h3>Load Session URL - mm_loadurl</h3>
					<p>
						If a call to <b>mmpost</b> has a request with a key <b>mm_loadurl</b>, an a web address
						as its value, then Math Minion will attempt to import a session from that address.
					</p>
					<p>
						Web security protocols (specifically CORS) may prevent you from importing from
						servers you don't control and thus can't set the appropriate permissions on. However
						it should alway be possible to load from the server hosting Math Minion itself.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="cmd" class="subsection">
					<h3>Calc Engine Command - mm_cmd</h3>
					<p>
						The user interface for Math Minion talks to the calculation engine by sending text
						messages to it and receiving text messages back. The
						<a href="console.html">console view</a> accessed by the button at the bottom of the
						<a href="infoview.html">information view</a> allows you to manually enter commands
						and view the results. The Html Page tool also has an action which allows you to
						send commands to the engine.						
					</p>
					<p>
						For example the HTML code:
					</p>
					<pre>
&lt;button onClick=
  "mmpost([],{mm_cmd: '.money.formula set formula 0 dollar'})"
&gt;
  Clear Money
&lt;/button&gt;
					</pre>
					<p>
						would create a button that when pressed would set the formula of the expression
						<b>money</b> to <b>0 dollar</b>.
					</p>
					<p>
						See the Html page is getting started for a more complete example.
					</p>
					<p class="reminder">
						<b>Note that the calculation engine
						runs in a separate process within your browser and no messages are sent to an
						external server.</b>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="parameters" class="section">
					<h3>Formula Parameters</h3>
					<p class="reminder">
					Parameters that can be accessed in the form a.b where a is the tool name and b
					is the parameter.
					</p>
					<p>
					Any input values posted to the object can be retrieved using their input names.
					Unless a value is just a number, it will be string value and have to be converted
					as appropriate, usually using the <b>eval</b> function.
					</p>
					<p>
					The parameter <b>html</b> will return the final HTML code after any mm tag replacements.
