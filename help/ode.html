						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>
							The ODE solver is used to integrate a set of one or more ordinary differential
							equations (ODE). An ODE is function with a single independent variable and a
							derivative with respect to that variable.
						</p>
						<p>			
							Essentially it determines y with respect to t from t=0 to some end point,
							where dy/dt is some function of y and y and dy/dt are arrays or tables of
							the same size.
						</p>
						<p>	
							Math Minion uses code derived from the Sundials suite of solvers developed at
							the Lawerence Livermore National Library in the US. It uses a variant of the
							Adam Moulton method for non-stiff problems and Backwards Difference Formulas (BDF)
							when the problem is designated as stiff.
						</p>
						<p>
							As the integration proceeds, the solver makes available an array or table of
							y values, which are initially, at t = 0, equal to the supplied Y0 value.
						</p>
						<p>
							These y values must be used to calculate a dy/dt array or table, which is
							used by the solver to calculate the next set of y values.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="info" class="section">
						<h3>Information View</h3>
						<p>
							Part of the information view for the ODE solver of the pendulum example
							in the Getting Started session is shown below.
						</p>
						<img src="ode.png" alt="ODE Solver Information View">
						<p>The inputs are:</p>
						<div id="stiff" class="subsection">
							<h3>Stiff</h3>
							<p>
								When checked, the solver will use a backward difference formula method for
								the integration.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is preferred when the time constants, or equivalent if time is not
								the independent variable, of the derivatives vary greatly in magnitude.
								That is, when some elements change very quickly compared to others.
							</p>
							<p>
								When this is unchecked, an Adam Moulton method is used.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="autorun" class="subsection">
							<h3>Auto Run</h3>
							<p>
								When this is checked, the solver will run automatically when required to by
								changes to its inputs etc.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Note:</b> When unchecked, changing the inputs to the calculation will not
								cause a reset to T=0. By extending the stop time the run can be resumed from
								where it stopped.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, recorded values will be erased and a new recording started from the
								resume point.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="tvalue" class="subsection">
							<h3>T Value</h3>
							<p>
								The current value of T will be displayed just below the stiff check box.
							<p>
						</div>
						<div id="addrec" class="subsection">
							<h3>Add Recording Button</h3>
							<p>
								This adds a <b>Recorded Value</b>> row to the bottom of the input table.
							</p>
							<p>
								The formula entered into this row will be evaluated at each NextT value of T
								and the results stored.
							</p>
							<p>
								They can be accessed as a parameter when the solution is complete.
							</p>
							<p>
								These parameters are named R1, R2 etc. and will return an array with values
								for each record interval.
							</p>
							<p>
								If the recorded values at each step are themselves arrays or matrices,
								then when accessed, a matrix will be returned with each row being the
								recorded step array or unwound matrix.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you supply a name as a comment to the recorded value formula (that is
								have a single quote followed by a name at the end of the formula), then
								you can use that name as a reference to the recorded value array, rather
								than the more cryptic R1, R2 etc.  Also if the formula is just a tool name,
								that can also be used as a parameter.
							</p>
							<p>
								Scrolling down, the rest of the information view from above looks like:
							</p>
							<img src="ode2.png" alt="bottom of information view">
							<p>
								The first recorded value has a comment <b>Time</b>, so the recorded values
								could be accessed from ode.time.
							</p>
							<p>
								The second recorded value has a formula that is just <b>Theta</b> and its value
								could be accessed by ode.theta.
							</p>
							<p>
								Along with the <a href="formulaeditor.html#fields">formula field</a> the last value
								for the recorded value is also displayed on the row.
							</p>
							<p>
								Tapping on the red <b>X</b> will remove that recording.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="reset" class="subsection">
							<h3>Reset</h3>
							<p>
								Sets the T value back to zero, the Y outputs to Y0 and forgets any recorded values.
								If auto run is checked, the solver will rerun immediately.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="run" class="subsection">
							<h3>Run</h3>
							<p>
								Runs the solver (happens automatically if auto run is checked).
							</p>
							<p>
								Note that if T is not zero and EndT is greater than T, presumably
								because it was modified, the solution will continue from the current T.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="y0" class="subsection">
							<h3>Y0 - Initial Values</h3>
							<p>
								The initial values for when T = 0. The size and type of this value will
								determine the size and type of the output Y values.
							</p>
							<p>
								At T = 0, the output Y values will have this value.  If Y0 is an <b>array</b>,
								then the output array will be an array the same unit type (all calculations
								are actually done in SI).
							</p>
							<p>
								If Y0 is a <b>table value</b>, then Y will be a table with the same number
								of columns and rows and the columns will have the same unit types as the
								corresponding columns in Y0.  That is the case in the example above.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="dydt" class="subsection">
						<h3>dY/dT</h3>
							<p>
								The calculated derivatives as a function of the output Y and T values.
							</p>
							<p>
								They must be the same type (array or table) and size as the Y0 value and
								their unit types should be compatible with those of Y0 / T, where the T
								unit type is the same as that for EndT.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="endt" class="subsection">
							<h3>EndT</h3>
							<p>
								The T value to stop at.
							</p>
							<p>
								The integration is always carried on from T = 0 to T = EndT, although you
								could perform transformations in your calculation of dY/dT to offset this
								if appropriate.
							</p>
							<p>
								The output T parameter will have the same unit type as this value.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="nextt" class="subsection">
							<h3>NextT - Next Recorded Time</h3>
							<p>
								This is the T value at which the next set of values for the formulas
								designated in the "Recorded Values" section should be recorded.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is first evaluated at T = 0 and then at each successive record time.
								It is done as a formula in terms of T so that non-linear record intervals
								can be specified.
							</p>
							<p>
								This value must have the same unit type as EndT.
							</p>
							<p>
								Note that this does not dictate the time step for the actual integration,
								which is determined by the need to keep accumulated errors in check.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="reltol" class="subsection">
							<h3>Relative Tolerance</h3>
							<p>
								This is a measure of the allowed relative errors. Thus the default
								 value of 1e-5 means the errors are controlled to 0.001%.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="abstol" class="subsection">
							<h3>Absolute Tolerance</h3>
							<p>
								This is used to control errors when a y value might become so small that
								relative error becomes meaningless.
							</p>
							<p>
								It should be set to some small value below which errors are unimportant.
							</p>
							<p>
								If Y0 is an array, this value can either be a scalar, in which case it is
								used for all values, or an array of the same size as Y0 if different
								tolerances are desired for the different elements.
							</p>
							<p>
								If Y0 is a table value, then this should be a table value with the same
								number of columns, but only a single row containing the tolerances to be
								used for the corresponding Y columns.
							</p>
							<p>
								It must have the same unit type(s) as Y0.  The default value is
							</p>
							<p class="formula">
								1.0e-10*{baseunit $.y}
							</p>
							<p>
								which ensures to correct unit is used.
							</p>
