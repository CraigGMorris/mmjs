				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					A model is simply a container for other <a href="tools.html">tools</a>.
					These are displayed as icons on the model's <a href="diagram.html">diagram view</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Every Math Minion session has one root model, but it can contain other models,
					which in turn can also contain models and so forth.
				</p>
					Tapping on the icon for a model in the <a href="diagram.html">diagram</a> will
					switch the diagram and <a href="infoview.html">information view</a> to that
					of the child model.
				<p>
				</p>
				<p>							
					You can return to the parent model by tapping the back button at the upper left
					of the diagram or model <a href="infoview.html">information view</a>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="namespace" class="section">
				<h3>Name Space</h3>
				<p>
					The name space of the model is completely independent of that of the parent
					model or any other model.  This means that models can contain tools with the same
					names as tools in other models.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="ioexpr" class="section">
				<h3>Input Expressions</h3>
				<p>
					An input <a href="expression.html">expression</a> operates in the namespace of
					the parent model, but its result is available in its containing model.  This
					means the formula entered into an input expression can only reference tools in
					the parent, but its result can be used by other tools in its own model.
				</p>
				<p>
					An expression is set to be an input by checking the 	<a href="expression.html#incheck">
					<b>Model Input check box</b></a> on an expression's information view.
				</p>
				<p>
					The result of any <a href="expression.html">expression</a> or other tool in a child
					model can be accessed by formulas in the parent model by appending a dot and its name
					to its model name. Thus if an  expression called "result" was in a model called "calc",
					then a formula in a tool in the model containing "calc" could reference "result" as:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">calc.result</p>
			</div>
			<div id="info" class="section">
				<h3>Information View</h3>
				<p>
					The information view for the circle model from the Getting Started session looks
					like this (after scrolling by the included overview):
				</p>
				<img src="model.png" alt="Model Information View">
				<p>
					If none of the tools in the model have any display boxes checked, then
					the information view will just display a list of the tools in the model.
					However as you add tools to the model, any that have their display box
					checked will appear in the model's information view instead.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a tool's <a href="notes.html">notes view</a>, you can
					also set that the notes should appear above its display in the model view.
				</p>
				<p>
					An expression can also be told to include an input field in the model view, where it's value
					can be directly set.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the view above, all three have been set for the <b>radius</b> expression, so the note
					appears, followed by an input field and then the result of evaluating the input.
				</p>
				<p>
					Below that, just the results of the <b>circumference</b> and <b>area</b> calculations are
					shown, and below those are the notes and plot of the <b>xyplot</b>
					<a href="graph.html"></a> tool.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this way you can create simple forms, reports or summaries for the calculations
					performed by a model.
				</p>
				<p>
					In all cases tapping on a tool name, will show that tool's
					<a href="infoview.html">information view</a> and select its icon on the
					<a href="diagram.html">diagram.</a>  If the selected tool is a model the
					diagram will switch to showing that model. You can use the back button at
					the top left to return to the original model information view.
				</p>
				<p>
					The order that tools are displayed is determined by their horizontal position
					on the model diagram, with ties being determined by the vertical position.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="print" class="section">
				<h3>Printing the View</h3>
				At the top left of the view there is a small non-scrolling printer icon
				and tapping on that will bring up a print dialog for printing the view.				
			</div>
			<div id="defaultview" class="section">
				<h3>Default View</h3>
				<p>
					It is possible to set a specific tool in the model to always be displayed in
					the information view when the model is first opened. Enter the name of this tool
					in the <b>Default View</b> input field at the bottom of the information view. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Empty the field 1f you wish to return to having the model information
					displayed when the model is first opened, 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="parameters" class="section">
				<h3>Formula Parameters</h3>		
				<p class="reminder">Parameters can be accessed with the form a.b where a is the model
					and b is the parameter</p>
				<p>
					All tools contained in the model are available as
					formula parameters and that tool's parameters will be available by extending
					the dot notation.  For instance, in the example above, a tool in
					the <b>A_Simple_Calc</b> model could use the formula
				</p>
				<p class="formula">circle.xyplot.x</p>
				<p>
					to retrieve an array of the x coordinate values from the xyplot graph in the circle model.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following will match only if the model does not contain a tool with a matching name.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>html</b> - a html code representation of the tool.</li>
					<li><b>notes</b> - the notes for the tool</li>
					<li><b>myname</b> - the name of the tool</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>
