				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					A Math Minion <a href="formula.html">formula</a> always evaluates to what I call a
					"minion value".   This critter can be any of the types below.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="numeric" class="section">
				<h3>Numeric</h3>
				<p>
					A numeric value consists of one or more floating point numbers, with an associated
					<a href="units.html">conversion unit</a> type such as length, time, temperature,
					dimensionless etc.  The numbers are always represented as a matrix, with a scalar
					just being a 1 by 1 matrix, a column array having 1 column and multiple rows and a
					row array having 1 row and multiple columns.
				</p>
				<p>
					Elements can be accessed using the array indexing operator [ ] (See
					<a href="formula.html#indices">formula indices</a>).
				</p>
				<p>
					Operations on numeric values also calculate the result's conversion unit type.
					For instance the formula:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					450 km / 4 h
				</p>
				<p>
					would return a velocity value.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="string" class="section">
				<h3>String</h3>
				<p>
					A string values consists of one or more text values.  Like numerics, these values
					are always in a matrix, with a single string just being a 1 by 1 matrix, a column array
					having 1 column and multiple rows and a row array having 1 row and multiple columns.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each element in a string matrix can be string of any length and any number of lines.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="table" class="section">
				<h3>Table Value</h3>
				<p>
					A table value is the result returned by operations on a
					<a href="datatable.html">data table</a> tool, but it also can be returned by
					parameters of other tools or can result from various
					<a href="formula.html#functions">function</a> calls.
				</p>
				<p>
					It consists of one or more columns (fields), each with its own name and
					<a href="units.html">conversion unit</a> type.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each row in the table can be thought of as similar to a record in a database.
				</p>
				<p>
					Elements can be accessed using the
					<a href="formula.html#indices">indexing operator</a> [ ].
					Column names or arrays of names can also be used for the column index.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="tool" class="section">
				<h3>Tool Reference</h3>
				<p>
					Tool references are not often used, but can be helpful in certain circumstances.
				</p>
				<p>
					When the name of an expression tool is referenced in a formula, it will evaluate to
					the minion value calculated by the expression's formula.  Similarly a matrix reference will be
					replaced by a numeric value and a data table reference with a table value.
				</p>
				<p>
					However other tools don't have values intrinsically associated with their names and
					a reference to them will become a tool reference.
				</p>
				<p>
					For instance if a model has an ordinary differential equation solver calling <b>integ</b>
					and an expression <b>x</b> with a formula that is just:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					integ
				</p>
				<p>
					then a formulas:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					integ.dy
				</p>
				<p>
					and
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					x.dy
				</p>
				<p>
					will both return the derivative values of the <b>integ</b> solver.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is rarely needed, but could be useful is when the expression with the tool reference is designated
					is an input expression.  This allows formulas in the model access to the
					parameters of the tool that it is referencing from the parent model.
				</p>
				<p>
					Arrays of tool references can be created by using the <b>tools</b> parameter of
					of model or by using the index operation <b>[]</b> with a model. The tools parameter
					will return an array of all the tools in the model, while the index operator will
					tools with names matching the string contained n the operator. The string can contain
					<b>*</b> wild card characters which will match any number of arbitrary characters. For instance
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					model1["field*"]
				</p>
				<p>
					would return all the tools in <b>model1</b> whose names started with "field".
				</p>
				<p>
					An index of "value" can be used with references to expression tool to get its value,
					Thus
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					model1["field*"]["value"]
				</p>
				<p>
					and assuming all the "field" tools were scalar expressions, would return an
					array with all the values of those fields. Note you must be sure all the
					expression have the same unit type.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tool arrays can be useful in constructing reports with values from various
					sub-models, but are rarely used otherwise.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally a tool reference can be made to any tool using the <b>self</b> parameter.  For example
					a reference to a data table named <b>dtable</b> would look like:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					dtable.self
				</p>
				<p>
					This a historical holdover that is retained for backwards compatibility.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="json" class="section">
				<h3>JSON Object</h3>
				<p>
					The <b>jsonparse</b> function creates a
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">javascript</a> object
					from a
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank">JSON</a>
					string and encapsulates it in a Math Minion <b>jsonvalue</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					This value is just displayed as a JSON string, but its members can be
					referenced with standard dot notation and some special index formats to
					create Math Minion string and number values.
				</p>
				<p>
					See Formulas.JsonValue model in the Getting Started session for details.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="empty" class="section">
				<h3>Empty</h3>
				<p>
					If there is not enough information to evaluate a formula, or if there is an error,
					then the value will be empty.  All formulas that reference an empty value will also
					evaluate to empty.
				</p>
