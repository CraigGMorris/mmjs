				<h3>Formula Fields</h3>
				<p>
					All information views for <a href="tools.html">tools</a> have one or more
					<a href="formula.html">formula</a> fields, like this:
				</p>
				<img src="formulafield.png" alt="a formula field"/>
				<p>
					Tapping on one of these will switch the
					information view to a <a href="#editor">formula editor</a> where you can enter or
					modify the formula.
				</p>
				<p>
					These fields can be identified by the equal sign in front of them. Tapping on the equal
					sign will cause the value calculated by the formula to be forgotten and recalculated.  This
					normally isn't necessary as Math Minion will forget and recalculate tools whenever one of
					their inputs is modified.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="editor" class="section">
				<h3>Formula Editor</h3>
				<p>
					The formula editor consists of five buttons and a large text area where the formula is
					entered or modified.
				</p>
				<img src="formulaedit.png" alt="formula editor"/>
				<p>
					The lower two are a <b>cancel</b> button and an <b>apply</b> button. The latter assigns
					the changes to the formula.  The keyboard shortcut <b>Shift-Enter</b> can also be used
					to invoke the apply button.
				</p>
				<p>
					The top three buttons open helper views where you can select elements to be inserted into
					the formula:
				</p>
				<div id="vbrowser" class="subsection">
					<h3>&lt;v&gt; - Value Browser</h3>
					<p>	
						Shows the available tools and parameters that you can insert into the formula. When
						first invoked, the available parameters will be the tools in the current model or in the
						case of the formula belonging to an input expression, the parent
						<a href="model.html">model</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you select a <a href="model.html">model</a>, then its name will appear below the
						buttons and the available parameters will be its tools.  When you select another type
						of tool, the available parameters for that tool will appear.  For instance
						the <a href="matrix.html">matrix tool</a> has parameters for the number of columns or rows it
						has.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the example below, the first selection was the <a href="model.html">model</a> named
						"circle", which contains a <a href="model.html">model</a> named "area".  When area was
						in turn selected, it was added to the expression below the buttons.  Tapping on
						<b>Insert</b> at this point would insert "circle.area" into the formula.
					</p>
					<img src="valuebrowser.png" alt="value browser"/>
				</div>
				<div id="ubrowser" class="subsection">
					<h3>"u" - Unit Browser</h3>
					<p>	
						Presents a view where you can select from the available <a href="units.html">units</a>.
						The left pane contains the defined types and selecting one of those will fill the right
						pane with the units that are defined for that type.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the image below, the type <b>Area</b> has been selected and then <b>hectare</b> was
						selected from the right pane.  This places the selected unit in the input field.
					</p>
					<img src="unitbrowser.png" alt="value browser"/>
					<p>
						Tapping the <b>Apply</b> button will insert the unit into the formula, enclosed in double
						quotes if it contains <b></b>, <b>/</b> or <b>^</b>.
					</p>
					<p>
						You aren't limited to the units listed and can create your own by combining existing
						units in the input field, either by typing them in directly, or by selecting
						them from the lists.  If you add a <b>-</b> or <b>/</b> operator to the end of the input
						field, selecting another unit will result in it being appended, rather than replacing the
						existing selection.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you need to define a completely new base unit, see custom units on the
						<a href="units.html">units</a> help page.
					</p>
					<p>
						This browser is also used for selecting display units for
						<a href="expression.html">expressions</a>,
						<a href="matrix.html">matrices</a>,
						<a href="datatable.html">data tables</a> and
						<a href="graph.html">graphs</a>.						
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="fbrowser" class="subsection">
					<h3>{f} - Function Browser</h3>
					<p>	
						Presents a view where you can browse the available built in Math Minion functions.
						As you can see in the image below, it has what are hopefully pretty clear
						instructions on how to use it.
					</p>
					<p>
						In this case the section for trigometric functions has been selected and then the
						sine function within it.
					</p>
					<img src="funcbrowser.png" alt="value browser"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div id="indent" class="section">
				<h3>Indenting</h3>
				<p>
					In more complex formulas and with some functions, it is common to space the formula out
					over multiple lines and use tabs to improve the readability. There are a couple of features
					to assist with this.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you add a new line to an already indented line, the editor will automatically match
					the indentation.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can increase or decrease the indentation of by selecting multiple lines and then typing
					<b>tab</b> or <b>shift-tab</b> respectively.
