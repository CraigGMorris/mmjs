				<h3>The Tools</h3>
				<p>
					The built in calculation tools are listed below. 
					To see the help page for a tool, just tap on its name.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b><a href="expression.html">Expression</a></b>
						- contains a single formula or constant.  For instance if an expression
						named <b>distance</b> has the formula:
						<p class="formula">
							5 km
						</p>
						<p>
							and an expression named <b>speed</b> has the formula:
						</p>
						<p class="formula">
							distance / 180 s
						</p>
						<p>
							then <b>speed's</b> value will be 27.78 m/s or 100 kph.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b><a href="datatable.html">Data Table</a></b>
							- a data base like table with named fields (columns) of different types.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b><a href="solver.html">Function Solver</a></b>
							- attempts to solve functions of the form
						</p>
						<p class="formula">
							f(x) = 0
						</p>
						<p>
							for one or more values of <b>x</b>.  That is it attempts to come up with a set
							of x values such that all the function values are 0.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b><a href="iterator.html">Iterator</a></b>
						- Math Minion's ability to work with arrays and matrices means traditional
						programming loops are usually not necessary, but if the need arises, this tool
						provides a <b>for loop</b> type capability.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b><a href="matrix.html">Matrix</a></b>
						- while all Math Minion numerical values are in fact matrices, this tool allows
						you to construct more complex entities, including cell formulas that refer to the
						values of other cells.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b><a href="model.html">Model</a></b>
						- a model is simply a container for other tools and is what is represented by the
						diagram view.
						<p>
							All Math Minion sessions have at least one root model, but models can contain other
							models, so a hierarchy of different models can be constructed.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b><a href="ode.html">ODE Solver (Integrator)</a></b>
						- the Ordinary Differential Equation solver is used integrate problems where:
						</p>
						<p class="formula">
							dy/dt = f(y, t)
						</p>
						<p>
							given an initial value for y, which can be a scalar, array or matrix.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b><a href="optimize.html">Optimizer</a></b>
						-	given some function:
						</p>
						<p class="formula">y = f(x)</p>
						<p>
							where y is a scalar and x can be a scalar or an array, the optimizer attempts
							to come up with the set of x values that produces the smallest value of y.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b><a href="graph.html">Graph</a></b>
						- displays a 2D or 3D plot.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b><a href="htmlpage.html">HTML Page</a></b>
						- used to create customized input and result views using HTML and javascript.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b><a href="importedmodel.html">Imported Model</a></b>
						- a <a href="model.html">model</a> that is imported from a different session.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Adding a Tool to the Model</h3>
				<p>
					To add a tool to the model, tap on the <a href="diagram.html">diagram</a>
					background where you wish the upper left hand of the tool's icon to be placed. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Select <b>Add Tool to Model</b> from the resulting <a href="diagram.html#bgmenu">menu</a>
					and then select the type of tool you wish from the list presented.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="icons" class="section">
				<h3>Icons</h3>
				<p>
					Tools are all represented on the diagram as rectangular icons, with connections being
					made from the corners of an icon to the middle of a vertical side of all the tools that
					reference it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each type of tool icon has a unique color and all except the expression icon have
					labels for the tool type and the tool's name.  The expression icon, has labels for
					the tool's name, formula (truncated as necessary) and calculated value.  Note the
					value won't be calculated until the tool is selected or a tool that depends on its
					value is selected.
