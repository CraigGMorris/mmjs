				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					While all Math Minion numerical calculations work with matrices, even if it is
					just a 1x1 matrix, there is also this specific matrix tool.
				</p>
				<p>
					It allows for a detailed specification of a matrix.  Here independent formulas
					can be supplied for each row, column or cell and these formulas are allowed to
					reference other cells in the matrix.
				</p>
				<p>
					Formulas can be entered into cells, row and column headers and the origin
					header at the upper left.
				</p>
				<p>
					The value for a cell is determined by first checking to see if it has a formula
					itself and if not then its corresponding row header, column header and finally
					the star header in that order.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note that the <b>row</b>, <b>col</b> and <b>cell</b>
					<a href="formula.html#functions">functions</a> are useful for referencing other cells in
					the matrix and can only be used in formulas inside matrix cells.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="info" class="section">
				<h3>Information View</h3>
				<p>
					Below is an image of the information view for a small matrix.
				</p>
				<img src="matrix.png" alt="Matrix Information View">
				<p>
					The cells with a gold background have formulas defining them, while a
					green background is used for the currently selected cell whose
					<a href="formula.html">formula</a> appears in the
					<a href="formulaeditor#field">formula field</a>. In this case it is the origin cell
					at the top left and its <a href="formula.html">formula</a> is:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					{row} * {col}
				</p>
				<p>
					which means any cell which doesn't have any other formula will have a value
					equal to its row number times its column number. In this case that would only
					be cells 1,1 and 4,1.
				</p>
				<p>
					The header cell for row 2 has a formula:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					{col} *10
				</p>
				<p>
					which sets the values of 2,1 and 2,2 to ten times the column number.
				</p>
				<p>
					The header cell for column 2 has the formula:
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					{row} * 100
				</p>
				<p>
					which sets the values for cells 1,2 and 4,2.  Row header formulas
					have precedence over column headers, so 2,2 is set by the row 2 header
					formula. Cell 3,2 has a constant 10000 as a formula and cell formulas always
					have priority.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally the formula for cell 3,1 is
				</p>
				<p class="formula">
					{cell -1, 1} * 5
				</p>
				<p>
					which says take the value from the cell one above me and one to the right. In
					other wordes 3,1 + -1,1 = 2,2. Cell 2,2 has a value of 20 which is multiplied
					by 5 to yield 100.
				</p>
				<div id="rowcols" class="subsection">
					<h3># Rows &amp; Columns</h3>
					<p>
						These <a href="formulaeditor.html#fields">formula fields</a> designate the number of rows
						and columns in the matrix.  While normally just a constants, they can be any
						legitimate Math Minion formula.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="formula" class="subsection">
					<h3>Formula Field</h3>
					<p>
						This <a href="formulaeditor.html#fields">formula field</a> shows the formula
						associated with the currently selected cell. Tapping on and cell place the
						<a href="formula.html">formula</a> for that cell in the field, where it can be
						entered or modified.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="current" class="subsection">
					<h3>Current Selection Indices</h3>
					<p>
						A pair of numbers in square brackets is displayed at the left of the view,
						below the <a href="#formula">formula field</a>.  This indicates
						the row and column numbers of the currently selected matrix cell.  Row and column
						headers have a zero index.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="unit" class="subsection">
					<h3>Conversion Unit</h3>
					<p>
						The default unit and unit type for the matrix are displayed to the right of the
						conversion selection indices.
					</p>
					<p>
						This should be set before any formulas are entered into the matrix, as all values
						in a matrix must be of the same unit type.
					</p>
					<p>
						If the unit needed doesn't exist in the unit browser, for instance something
						like <b>"s^0.3"</b>, then be sure to first assign a formula to the default cell
						0,0 which will have the correct unit dimension. For example, perhaps
						<b>0 s^0.3</b> in this case.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="scrolling" class="subsection">
					<h3>Scrolling</h3>
					As with other tools, the cell matrix can be scrolled by dragging and dragging
					the header row or column will scroll rapidly. 
				</div>
			<div id="parameters" class="section">
				<h3>Formula Parameters</h3>
				<p class="reminder">Parameters that can be accessed in the form a.b where a is the tool name and b is the parameter name.</p>
				<p>
					<b>Note</b> - use these parameters (for example $.nrow) in self referencing cell formulas, rather than the nrows or ncols functions or the [] operator.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>nrow</b> - number of rows in the matrix.</li>
					<li><b>ncol</b> - number of columns in the matrix.</li>
					<li><b>r_c</b> - the value of the element at row number r and column number c,
						where r and c are numbers.  e.g. 3_4</li>
					<li><b>solved</b> - 1 if the matrix has successfully been calculated, 0 otherwise.</li>
					<li><b>table</b> - returns the matrix contents as a table value.  The column names
						will just be the column numbers.</li>
				</ul>
