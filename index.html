		</p>
		<p>
			Math Minion is a general purpose calculation tool that runs completely in the
			browser and is completely
			<a href="help/freeprivate.html">free and private</a>.
		</p>
		<div class="center"><img src="screenshot.png" alt="Screen shot"></div>
		<p>	
			It combines a <a href="help/diagram.html">mind map</a> style diagram of the
			relationships between a range of <a href="help/tools.html">calculation tools</a>,
			with a <a href="help/formula.html">formula system</a> that operates transparently
			on scalars, arrays and matrices. It also includes a
			<a href="help/units.html">comprehensive conversion unit system</a> 
			that performs dimensional analysis on all calculations.
		</p>	
		<p>
			Best of all, if you have a reasonably recent browser and can wait a few seconds for
			it to load, you can try it right now by tapping on <a href="run.html">Run</a>.

		<h4>Known Problems</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><b>Data Loss with Apple Safari!!!</b><br>
					An update to Safari in late May 2021 introduced changes to its cross site tracking
					provisions that impact the in browser database that Math Minion uses to store sessions.  It 
					appears that this database gets cleared when the browser restarts and perhaps in other
					conditions.
				</p>
				<p>
					I think this occurs because I use a CName redirect to make <b>mathminion.org/run.html</b>
					point to the less friendly real address:
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.mathminion.org/run.html">https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.mathminion.org/run.html</a>
				</p>
				<p>This affects Safari on the Mac and all browsers on iOS devices.  Turning off cross site
					tracking in the preferences solves this or if you don't want to do that, just use the link
					above instead of the normal run link.  Note that using a different link will start with just
					the Getting Started session, so be sure to export your sessions from the original link and
					reimport them with the new one.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>It is important to frequently export your sessions</b> so you have hard drive backup of
					the browser based storage.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>iPad Mouse and Trackpad</b><br>
					There is some strange behaviour when you mix trackpad (or mouse) use with touch dragging
					or pinching on the screen. The latter will always work, but disables the trackpad on the
					diagram, graphs and result tables. Also pinch zooming on the trackpad doesn't work and
					should be avoided. Use the + and - zoom icons on the diagram instead.  Reloading will
					restore things.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any thoughts on
					the cause of this would be most welcome.
