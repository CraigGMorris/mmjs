			and the <a href="http://www.redtree.com/contact.html">reporting</a> of them would be appreciated)
		</p>
		<p>
			Math Minion is a general purpose calculation tool that runs completely in the
			browser and is completely
			<a href="help/freeprivate.html">free and private</a>.
		</p>
		<div class="center"><img src="screenshot.png" alt="Screen shot"></div>
		<p>	
			It combines a <a href="help/diagram.html">mind map</a> style diagram of the
			relationships between a range of <a href="help/tools.html">calculation tools</a>,
			with a <a href="help/formula.html">formula system</a> that operates transparently
			on scalars, arrays and matrices. It also includes a
			<a href="help/units.html">comprehensive conversion unit system</a> 
			that performs dimensional analysis on all calculations.
		</p>	
		<p>
			Best of all, if you have a reasonably recent browser and can wait a few seconds for
			it to load, you can try it right now by tapping on <a href="run.html">Run</a>.
		</p>
		<h4>Math Minion and CoolProp</h4>
		<p>A version of Math Minion is now available that has a fluid flash tool based
			on the open source <a href="http://coolprop.org">CoolProp</a> property package.
			You can run it at <a href="http://coolmm.mathminion.org">coolmm.mathminion.org</a>,
			but please be patient, for there is a lot of code to download.  It has examples with
			fairly detailed explanations and of course help for the flash tool.
		</p>
		<p>
			The source code is in the
			<a href="https://github.com/CraigGMorris/mmjs">GitHub repository</a> as branch
			<b>coolmm</b>.
		</p>

		<h4>Known Problems</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>iPad Mouse and Trackpad</b><br>
					There is some strange behaviour when you mix trackpad (or mouse) use with touch dragging
					or pinching on the screen. The latter will always work, but disables the trackpad on the
					diagram, graphs and result tables. Also pinch zooming on the trackpad doesn't work and
					should be avoided. Use the + and - zoom icons on the diagram instead.  Reloading will
					restore things.				
				<p>
					Any thoughts on the cause of this would be most welcome.
