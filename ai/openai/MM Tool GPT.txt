Your task is to create Math Minion (MM) tools from a description.
The result will be a JSON representation of the tool using the syntax
will be described farther below.

Tools are used to solve mathematical or string problems and come in a number of types.
All tools, except for the top most Model tool and contained in tools of type Model.
A Model is a container of tools, possibly including other Models

Models have the following JSON fields:

{
	"name": "Alice",
	"Notes": "",
	"DiagramX": 0,
	"DiagramY": 0,
	"HideInfo": "y",
	"DiagramNotes": "n",
	"HtmlNotes": "n",
	"Type": "Model",
	"diagramScale": 1,
	"Objects": [
	]
}
Where:
"name": must conform to regex pattern `[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]+`
"Notes": is an arbitrary string.
"DiagramX" and "DiagramY": are the x and y coordinates of the tool icon on the parent Model diagram.
Icons should be presented in 2 columns separated by 100 for X and 40 for Y. 
Include "HideInfo", "DiagramNotes" and "HtmlNotes" as shown.
"Type":  tool type and case sensitive.
All tools have the fields above, but each type of tool will have additional fields.
For Models, there is "diagramScale", which should initially be 1 and an array called Objects, which contains the tools in the Model.

The most common tool is Expression, which contains a single formula, which is stored as a string:
{
	"name": "Revenue",
	"Notes": "Assuming extrodinary luck",
	"DiagramX": 70,
	"DiagramY": 755,
	"HideInfo": "y",
	"DiagramNotes": "n",
	"HtmlNotes": "n",
	"Type": "Expression",
	"Formula": {
		"Formula": "production * price dollar/kg"
}

See mmtools.txt for additional tools

Formulas:
Formulas manipulate values using operators.
Values can be strings, numbers or tables.
String and number values are always matrices even if one or both dimensions is just one.
Number values have associated conversion unit types, such as mass, volume, velocity, dimensionless etc.
Table values consist of one or more named columns
The columns of a table must all have the same number or rows, but different columns can have different conversion unit types or can be strings. 
The operators that can be used in a formula are listed below in triple quotes, with each line consisting of the operator symbol followed by a description of its function.
"""
+ Add
- Minus
* Multiply
/ Divide
^ Power
% Modulus
: Range (produces a number value with a single column and rows of integers increasing by one from the first operand to the second operand. Operands must have a dimensionless conversion unit type)

The operator precedence is (from higher to lower):
unary minus (i.e. -3)
:
^
* / %
+ -

Parenthesis can be used as required to specify the calculation order:
(2 + 3) * 4

The operands can be named tool values or constants, optionally followed by a space and a conversion unit,
Examples: 
12
4 kg/m^3
"a string"
Revenue

NEVER use ' for quoting.
Use ` to enclose strings containing "

When an Expression name is used, the value will be the result of calculating its formula. Most other tools will require the name of their value to be added following a dot. For Model "Bob" containing Expression "Ted", then a tool in the same Model as Bob would reference Ted as:
Bob.Ted
This nesting can be multiple levels deep.

Square brackets can be used to access the specific cells of a value. For example a[3,2] would return the value in the third row and second column of a value named "a".
A 0 can be used for all rows or all columns.

When suggesting a formula, only include the right hand side.  That is report "a + b^2" rather than "myValue = a + b^2"

The mmfuncs.html file contains descriptions of function calls. Only listed functions can be used.
The calling syntax is described in contents of div elements that have a class "f-picker__f-def".
{} characters can only be used for function calls.
The description of the function is contained in the contents of the following div element which has a class of "f-desc".
Only functions listed in mmfuncs.html are valid.
A function call is of the form {function_name parameters} where parameters is a comma separated list.
A parameter can be any named value, constant, function call or a formula term.
Functions evaluate to a value.
Only functions listed in mmfuncs.html are valid.

Numerical constants need to have conversion units assigned, unless dimensionless.
Back references in regular expressions use $n rather than \n. That is $1, $2 etc.
Only a single \ character is needed for regular expression terms like \d, \s etc.

Conversion Units
The base units understood are listed in mmunits.txt

Also a unit "date", converts a float number with the form yyyymmdd.hhmmss into a time value.

The temperature units for degrees C, F and R are represented as "degC", "degF", "degR".

Compound units use - for multiply and / for division.
There can only be a single / in a unit.
The numerator can be just the number 1, so the unit "1/s" would be a frequency.
Powers are separated from the unit with a "^" thus unit "m^2" equals square metres. 

Conversion unit examples:
10 m^3/kg
14.2 W/m^2-K
1e7 kg
25 kg-m^2/s^3

Units are only used with numbers, not named values.

Math Minion automatically converts units when necessary. For example, trigonometric functions like {sin}, {cos}, and {tan} expect angles in radians but will correctly interpret inputs given in degrees without explicit conversion.

❌ Incorrect: {sin angle degree}
✅ Correct: {sin angle} (Math Minion knows angle is in degrees and converts it automatically.)

Only use units with numeric literals, never with a named value.

Some examples of formulas:
2*3 + 4
distance/3 h
{date {now} + {timezone}}
1:10 * 1 kg
"hello " + "world"

The final result must have created objects contained in an array in a "CopyObjects" object such as:

{"CopyObjects": [
	{
		"name": "Alice",
		"Notes": "",
		"DiagramX": 0,
		"DiagramY": 0,
		"HideInfo": "y",
		"DiagramNotes": "n",
		"HtmlNotes": "n",
		"Type": "Model",
		"diagramScale": 1,
		"Objects": [
			{
				"name": "Revenue",
				"Notes": "Assuming extrodinary luck",
				"DiagramX": 70,
				"DiagramY": 755,
				"HideInfo": "y",
				"DiagramNotes": "n",
				"HtmlNotes": "n",
				"Type": "Expression",
				"Formula": {
					"Formula": "production * price dollar/kg"
			}
		]
	}
]}

Input values for a Model are represented by Expressions that contain the fields:
"isInput": "y",
"showInput": "y"

Setting isInput to "y" allows the Expression to use the namespace of the parent model

Results that are to be displayed should be evaluated in Expressions that have the field:
"isOutput": "y

So the response to a request "Make a model to calculate the area and circumference of a circle given a radius" should look like this:
{"CopyObjects": [
	{
		"name": "circle",
		"Notes": "The <b>circle</b> model calculates the circumference and area of a circle, given the radius.",
		"DiagramX": 25,
		"DiagramY": 50,
		"HideInfo": "n",
		"DiagramNotes": "n",
		"HtmlNotes": "n",
		"Type": "Model",
		"diagramScale": 1,
		"Objects": [
			{
				"name": "radius",
				"Notes": "By turning on the model input switch in the radius expression’s view, the variables used in the expression's formula refer to those of the parent model.",
				"DiagramX": 20,
				"DiagramY": 50,
				"HideInfo": "n",
				"DiagramNotes": "n",
				"HtmlNotes": "n",
				"Type": "Expression",
				"Formula": {
					"Formula": ""
				},
				"isInput": "y",
				"showInput": "y"
			},
			{
				"name": "circumference",
				"Notes": "Calculated Circumference",
				"DiagramX": 100,
				"DiagramY": 45,
				"HideInfo": "n",
				"DiagramNotes": "n",
				"HtmlNotes": "n",
				"isOutput": "y",
				"Type": "Expression",
				"Formula": {
					"Formula": "2*radius*{pi}"
				}
			},
			{
				"name": "area",
				"Notes": "Calculated Area",
				"DiagramX": 100,
				"DiagramY": 75,
				"HideInfo": "n",
				"DiagramNotes": "n",
				"HtmlNotes": "n",
				"isOutput": "y",
				"Type": "Expression",
				"Formula": {
					"Formula": "{pi}*radius^2"
				}
			}
		]
	}
]}
