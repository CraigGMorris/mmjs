		<p>
			For my own use I have created a stand alone Mac application of Math Minion
			using <a href="https://electronjs.org">ElectronJS</a>.
			This is an open source bundling of <a href="https://nodejs.org">NodeJS</a>
			and the <a href="https://chromium.org">Chromium browser</a> in a desktop application.
		</p>
		<p>
			While it is functionally identical to the web version, it doesn't require the
			Internet or a local server to run and loads almost instantly. A tiny additional
			benefit is the wfetch function does not suffer from the cross origin restrictions
			it does in a browser.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, since I don't know if there is any interest in this, I haven't done the dance with
			Apple to notarize the program. THis means that if it is download by a browser,
			Apple's Gatekeepernwill quarantine it and attempts to run it would be blocked
			with warnings and promptsnnto trash it.
			There are ways a user can remove the quarantine, but doing so on an
			app downloaded from a randon web site is hardly recommended.
		</p>
		<p>
			If I get sufficient expression of interest (
				<a href="https://redtree.com/contact.html">Contact Me</a>),
			I will consider doing battle with Apple to get it notarized.
		</p>
		<p>
			While I don't currently even have a Windows machine, in theory producing a Windows
			version is also quite doable. Once again I would have to have some definite indication
			of interest before embarking on such a project.
